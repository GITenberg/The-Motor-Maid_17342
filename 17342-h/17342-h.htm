<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p>One hears of people whose hair turned white in a
single night. Last night I thought mine was
turning. I had a creepy feeling in the roots,
which seemed to crawl all the way down inside each separate
hair, wriggling as it went. I suppose you couldn't
have nervous prostration of the hair? I worried dreadfully,
it kept on so long; and my hair is so fair it would be
almost a temptation for it, in an emergency, to take the
one short step from gold to silver. I didn't dare switch
on the light in the <i>wagon-lit</i> and peep at my pocket-book
mirror (which reflects one's features in sections of a square
inch, giving the survey of one's whole face quite a panorama
effect) for fear I might wake up the Bull Dog.</p>

<p>I've spelt him with capitals, after mature deliberation,
because it would be nothing less than <i>l&egrave;se majest&eacute;</i> to fob
him off with little letters about the size of his two lower
eye-tusks, or chin-molars, or whatever one ought to call
them.</p>

<p>He was on the floor, you see, keeping guard over his
mistress's shoes; and he might have been misguided
enough to think I had designs on them&mdash;though what
I could have used them for, unless I'd been going to
Venice and wanting a private team of gondolas, I can't
imagine.</p>

<p>I being in the upper berth, you might (if you hadn't seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
him) have fancied me safe; but already he had once
padded half-way up the step-ladder, and sniffed at me
speculatively, as if I were a piece of meat on the top shelf
of a larder; and if half-way up, why not all the way up?
<i>Il &eacute;tait capable du tout.</i></p>

<p>I tried to distract my mind and focus it hard on other
things, as Christian Scientists tell you to do when you
have a pin sticking into your body for which <i>les convenances</i>
forbid you to make an exhaustive search.</p>

<p>I lay on my back with my eyes shut, trying not to hear
any of the sounds in the <i>wagon-lit</i> (and they were not
confined to the snoring of His Majesty), thinking
desperately. "I will concentrate all my mentality,"
said I to myself, "on thoughts beginning with P, for
instance. My Past. Paris. Pamela."</p>

<p>Just for a few minutes it was comparatively easy.
"Dear Past!" I sighed, with a great sigh which for divers
reasons I was sure couldn't be heard beyond my own
berth. (And though I try always even to <i>think</i> in English,
I find sometimes that the words group themselves in my
head in the old patterns&mdash;according to French idioms.)
"Dear Past, how thou wert kind and sweet! How it is
brutalizing to turn my back upon thee and thy charms
forever!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness, I shall certainly die!" squeaked a
voice in the berth underneath; and then there was a sound
of wallowing.</p>

<p>She (my stable-companion, shall I call her?) had been
giving vent to all sorts of strange noises at intervals, for a
long time, so that it would have been hopeless to try and
drown my sorrows in sleep.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>Away went the Gentle Past with a bump, as if it had
knocked against a snag in the current of my thoughts.</p>

<p>Paris or Pamela instead, then! or both together, since
they seem inseparable, even when Pamela is at her most
American, and tells me to "talk United States."</p>

<p>It was all natural to think of Pamela, because it was
she who gave me the ticket for the <i>train de luxe</i>, and my
berth in the <i>wagon-lit</i>. If it hadn't been for Pamela I
should at this moment have been crawling slowly, cheaply,
down Riviera-ward in a second-class train, sitting bolt
upright in a second-class carriage with smudges on my
nose, while perhaps some second-class child shed jammy
crumbs on my frock, and its second-class baby sister
howled.</p>

<p>"Oh, why did I leave my peaceful home?" wailed the
lady in the lower berth.</p>

<p>Heaven alone (unless it were the dog) knew why she
had, and knew how heartily I wished she hadn't. A
good thing Cerberus was on guard, or I might have
dropped a pillow accidentally on her head!</p>

<p>Just then I wasn't thanking Pamela for her generosity.
The second-class baby's mamma would have given it a
bottle to keep it still; but there was nothing I could give
the fat old lady; and she had already resorted to the
bottle (something in the way of patent medicine) without
any good result. Yet, <i>was</i> there nothing I could give her?</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm dying, I <i>know</i> I'm dying, and nobody
cares! I shall choke to death!" she gurgled.</p>

<p>It was too much. I could stand it and the terrible
atmosphere no longer. I suppose, if I had been an early
Christian martyr, waiting for my turn to be devoured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
might have so got on my nerves eventually that I
would have thrown myself into the arena out of sheer
spite at the lions, and then tried my best to disagree
with them.</p>

<p>Anyway, Bull Dog or no Bull Dog, having made a light,
I slid down from my berth&mdash;no thanks to the step-ladder&mdash;dangled
a few wild seconds in the air, and then
offering&mdash;yes, offering my stockinged feet to the Minotaur,
I poked my head into the lower berth.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" gasped its occupant,
<i>la grosse femme</i> whose fault it would be if my hair did
change from the gold of a louis to the silver of a mere
franc.</p>

<p>"You say you're stifling," I reminded her, politely
but firmly, and my tone was like the lull before a storm.</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;" We were staring into each other's
eyes, and&mdash;could I believe my sense of touch, or was it
mercifully blunted? It seemed that the monster on the
floor was gently licking my toes with a tongue like a
huge slice of pink ham, instead of chewing them to the
bone. But there are creatures which do that to their
victims, I've heard, by way of making it easier to swallow
them, later.</p>

<p>"You also said no one cared," I went on, courageously.
"<i>I</i> care&mdash;for myself as well as for you. As for what
I'm going to do&mdash;I'm going to do several things. First,
open the window, and then&mdash;<i>then I'm going to undress you</i>."</p>

<p>"You must be mad!" gasped the lady, who was
English. Oh, but more English than any one else I ever
saw in my life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>"Not yet," said I, as I darted at the thick blind she had
drawn down over the window, and let it fly up with a
snap. I then opened the window itself, a few inches, and
in floated a perfumed breath of the soft April air for
which our bereaved lungs had been longing. The breeze
fluttered round my head like a benediction until I felt that
the ebbing tide of gold had turned, and was flowing into
my back hair again.</p>

<p>"No wonder you're dying, madam," I exclaimed,
switching the heat-lever to "Froid." "So was I, but
being merely an Upper Berth, with no rights, I was suffering
in silence. I watched you turn the heat full on, and shut
the window tight. I saw you go to bed in <i>all</i> your clothes,
which looked terribly thick, and cover yourself up with
both your blankets; but I said nothing, because you were
a Lower Berth, and older than I am. I thought maybe
you <i>wanted</i> a Turkish Bath. But since you don't&mdash;I'll
try and save you from apoplexy, if it isn't too late."</p>

<p>I fumbled with brooches and buttons, with hooks and
eyes. It was even worse than I'd supposed. The
creature's conception of a travelling costume <i>en route</i>
for the South of France consisted of a heavy tweed dress,
two gray knitted stay-bodices, one pink Jaeger chemise,
and a couple of red flannel petticoats. My investigations
went no further; but, encouraged in my rescue work
by spasmodic gestures on the part of the patient, and
forbearance on the part of the dog, I removed several
superfluous layers of wool. One blanket went to the
floor, where it was accepted in the light of a gift by His
Majesty, and the other was returned to its owner.</p>

<p>"Now are you better, madam?" I asked, panting with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>long and well-earned breaths. She reposed on an elbow,
gazing up at me as at a surgeon who has performed a
painful but successful operation; and she was an object
<i>pour faire rire</i>, the poor lady!</p>

<p>She wore an old-fashioned false front of hair, "sunning
over with curls" (brown ones, of a brown never seen on
land or sea), and a pair of spectacles, pushed up in an
absent-minded moment, were entangled in its waves.
Her face, which was large, with a knot of tiny features in
the middle, shone red with heat and excitement. She
would have had the look of an elderly child, if it hadn't
been for her bright, shrewd little eyes, which twinkled
observantly&mdash;and might sparkle with temper. Nobody
who was not rich and important would dare to dress as
badly as she did. Altogether she was a figure of fun.
Indeed, I couldn't help feeling what quaint mantelpiece
ornaments she and her dog would make. Yet, for some
reason, I didn't feel inclined to laugh, and I eyed her as
solemnly as she eyed me. As for His Majesty, I began
to see that I had misunderstood him. After all, he had
never, from the first, regarded me as an eatable.</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>am</i> better," replied His Majesty's mistress.
"People have always told me it came on treacherously
cold at night in France, so I prepared accordingly. I
suppose I ought to thank you. In fact, I do thank
you."</p>

<p>"I acted for myself as much as for you," I confessed.
"It was so hot, and you were suffering out loud."</p>

<p>"I have never travelled at night before," the lady
defended herself. "Indeed, I've made a point of travelling
as little as possible, except by carriage. I don't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>consider trains a means of conveyance for gentlefolk.
They seem well enough for cattle who may not mind
being herded together."</p>

<p>"Or for dogs," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Nothing is too good for Beau&mdash;my <i>only</i> Beau!" (at
this I did not wonder). "But I wouldn't have moved
without him. He's as necessary to me as my conscience.
I was afraid the guard was going to make a
fuss about him, which would have been awkward, as I
can't speak a word of French, or any other silly language
into which Latin has degenerated. But luckily English
gold doesn't need to be translated."</p>

<p>"It loses in translation," said I, amused. I sat down
on my bag as I spoke, and timorously invited Beau
(never was name less appropriate) to be patted. He arose
from the blanket and accepted my overtures with an
expression which may have been intended for a smile,
or a threat of the most appalling character. I have
seen such legs as his on old-fashioned silver teapots;
and the crook in his tail would have made it useful
as a door-knocker.</p>

<p>"I don't think I ever saw him take so to a stranger,"
exclaimed his mistress, suddenly beaming.</p>

<p>"I wonder you risked him with me in such close
quarters then," said I. "Wouldn't it have been safer if
you'd had your maid in the compartment with you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My maid? My tyrant!" snorted the old lady.
"She's the one creature on earth I am afraid of, and she
knows it. When we got to Dover, and she saw the
Channel wobbling about a little, she said it was a great
nasty wet thing, and she wouldn't go on it. When I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>insisted, she showed symptoms of seasickness; and in
consequence she is waiting for me in Dover till I finish
the business that's taking me to Italy. I had no more
experience than she, but I had <i>courage</i>. It's perhaps a
question of class. Servants consider only themselves.
You, too, I see, have courage. I was inclined to think
poorly of you when you first came in, and to wish
I'd been extravagant enough to take the two beds for
myself, because I thought you were afraid of Beau. Yet
now you're patting him."</p>

<p>"I <i>was</i> rather afraid at first," I admitted. "I never met
an English bull dog socially before."</p>

<p>"They're more angels than dogs. Their one interest in
life is love&mdash;for their friends; and they wouldn't
hurt a fly."</p>

<p>"Larger game would be more in their way, I should
think," said I. "But I'm glad he likes me. I like to
be liked. It makes me feel more at home in life."</p>

<p>"H'm! That's a funny idea!" remarked the old
lady. "'At home in life!' You've made yourself pretty
well at home in this <i>wagon-lit</i>, anyhow, taking off all your
clothes and putting on your nightgown. I should never
have thought of that. It seems hardly decent. Suppose
we should be killed."</p>

<p>"Most people do try to die in their nightgowns, when
you come to think of it," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, you have a quaint way of putting things.
There's something very original about you, my dear
young woman. I thought you were mysterious at first,
but I believe it's only the effect of originality."</p>

<p>"I don't know which I'd rather be," I said, "original
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>or mysterious, if I couldn't afford both. But I'm not
a young woman."</p>

<p>"Goodness!" exclaimed the old lady, wrinkling up
her eyes to stare at me. "I may be pretty blind, but it
can't be make-up."</p>

<p>I laughed. "I mean <i>je suis jeune fille</i>. I'm not a
young woman. I'm a young girl."</p>

<p>"Dear me, is there any difference?"</p>

<p>"There is in France."</p>

<p>"I'm not surprised at queer ideas in France, or any
other foreign country, where I've always understood that
<i>anything</i> may happen. Why can't everybody be English?
It would be so much more simple. But you're not
French, are you?"</p>

<p>"Half of me is."</p>

<p>"And what's the other half, if I may ask?"</p>

<p>"American. My father was French, my mother American."</p>

<p>"No wonder you don't always feel at home in life,
divided up like that!" she chuckled. "It must be so
upsetting."</p>

<p>"Everything is upsetting with me lately," I said.</p>

<p>"With me too, if it comes to that&mdash;or would be, if it
weren't for Beau. What a pity you haven't got a Beau,
my dear."</p>

<p>I smiled, because (in the Americanized sense of the
word) I had one, and was running away from him as
fast as I could. But the thought of Monsieur Charretier
as a "beau" made me want to giggle hysterically.</p>

<p>"You say 'was,' when you speak of your father and
mother," went on the old lady, with childlike curiosity,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>which I was encouraging by not going back to bed.
"Does that mean that you've lost them?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>"And lately?"</p>

<p>"My father died when I was sixteen, my mother left
me two years ago."</p>

<p>"You don't look more than nineteen now."</p>

<p>"I'm nearly twenty-one."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mean to catechize you, though one
certainly must get friendly&mdash;or the other way&mdash;I
suppose, penned up in a place like this all night. And
you've really been very kind to me. Although you're
a pretty girl, as you must know, I didn't think at first
I was going to like you so much."</p>

<p>"And I didn't you," I retorted, laughing, because I
really did begin to like the queer old lady now, and was
glad I hadn't dropped a pillow on her head.</p>

<p>"That's right. Be frank. I like frankness. Do
you know, I believe you and I would get on very well
together if our acquaintance was going to be continued?
If Beau approves of a person, I let myself go."</p>

<p>"You use him as if he were a barometer."</p>

<p>"There you are again, with your funny ideas! I shall
remember that one, and bring it out as if it were my
<i>own</i>. I consider myself quite lucky to have got you for a
travelling companion. It's such a comfort to hear English
again, and talk it, after having to converse by gesture&mdash;except
with Beau. I hope you're going on to Italy?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm getting off at Cannes."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. But I suppose you're glad?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly," said I.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>"I've always heard that Cannes was gay."</p>

<p>"It won't be for me."</p>

<p>"Your relations there don't go out much?"</p>

<p>"I've no relations in Cannes. Aren't you tired now,
and wouldn't you like me to make you a little more
comfortable?"</p>

<p>"Does that mean that <i>you're</i> tired of answering questions?
I haven't meant to be rude."</p>

<p>"You haven't been," I assured her. "You're very
kind to take an interest."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'm <i>not</i> tired, and I <i>wouldn't</i> like to be
made more comfortable. I'm very well as I am. Do
you want to go to sleep?"</p>

<p>"I want to, but I know I can't. I'm getting hungry.
Are you?"</p>

<p>"Getting? I've <i>got</i>. If Simpkins were here I'd
have her make us tea, in my tea-basket."</p>

<p>"I'll make it if you like," I volunteered.</p>

<p>"A French&mdash;a half French&mdash;girl make tea?"</p>

<p>"It's the American half that knows how."</p>

<p>"You look too ornamental to be useful. But you
can try."</p>

<p>I did try, and succeeded. It was rather fun, and never
did tea taste so delicious. There were biscuits to go
with it, which Beau shared; and I do wish that people
(other people) were obliged to make faces when they
eat, such as Beau has to make, because if so, one could
add a new interest to life by inviting even the worst
bores to dinner.</p>

<p>I was fascinated with his contortions, and I did not
attempt to conceal my sudden change of opinion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>concerning Beau as a companion. When I had humbly
invited him to drink out of my saucer, which I held from
high tide to low, I saw that my conquest of his mistress
was complete. Already we had exchanged names, as
well as some confidences. I knew that she was Miss
Paget, and she knew that I was Lys d'Angely; but after
the tea-drinking episode she became doubly friendly.</p>

<p>She told me that, owing to an unforeseen circumstance
(partly, even largely, connected with Beau) which had
caused a great upheaval in her life, she had now not a
human being belonging to her, except her maid Simpkins,
of whom she would like to get rid if only she knew how.</p>

<p>"Talk of the Old Man of the Sea!" she sighed. "<i>He</i>
was an afternoon caller compared with Simpkins. She's
been on my back for twenty years. I suppose she will
be for another twenty, unless I slam the door of the family
vault in her face."</p>

<p>"Couldn't Beau help you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Even Beau is powerless against her. She has
hypnotized him with marrow bones."</p>

<p>"You've escaped from her for the present," I suggested.
"She's on the other side of the Channel. Now
is your time to be bold."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I can't stop out of England for ever, and I
tell you she's waiting for me at Dover. A relative (a
very eccentric one, and quite different from the rest of
us, or he wouldn't have made his home abroad) has left
me a house in Italy, some sort of old castle, I believe&mdash;so
unsuitable! I'm going over to see about selling it
for I've no one to trust but myself, owing to the circumstances
of which I spoke. I want to get back as soon as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>possible&mdash;I hope in a few weeks, though how I shall
manage without any Italian, heaven may know&mdash;I
don't! Do you speak it?"</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish I could have you with me. You'd make
a splendid companion for an old woman like me: young,
good to look at, energetic (or you wouldn't be travelling
about alone), brave (conquered your fear of Beau),
accomplished (three languages, and goodness knows what
besides!), presence of mind (the way you whisked my
clothes off), handy (I never tasted better tea)&mdash;altogether
you sum up ideally. What a pity you're rich,
and out of the market!"</p>

<p>"If I look rich my appearance must be more distinguished
than I supposed&mdash;and it's also very deceiving,"
said I.</p>

<p>"You're rich enough to travel for pleasure in <i>wagon-lits</i>,
and have silver-fitted bags."</p>

<p>"I'm not travelling for pleasure. You exaggerate
my bags and my <i>wagon-lits</i>, for I've only one of each;
and both were given me by a friend who was at the Convent
with me."</p>

<p>"The Convent! Good heavens! are you an escaping nun?"</p>

<p>I laughed. "I went to school at a Convent. That
was when I thought I <i>was</i> going to be rich&mdash;at least,
rich enough to be like other girls. And if I <i>am</i> 'escaping'
from something, it isn't from the arms of religion."</p>

<p>"If you're not rich, and aren't going to relatives, why
not take an engagement with me? Come, I'm in earnest.
I always make up my mind suddenly, if it's anything
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>important, and hardly ever regret it. I'm sure we should
suit. You've got no nonsense about you."</p>

<p>"Oh yes I have, lots!" I broke in. "That's all
I have left&mdash;that, and my sense of humour. But
seriously, you're very kind&mdash;to take me on faith like this&mdash;especially
when you began by thinking me mysterious.
I'd accept thankfully, only&mdash;I'm engaged already."</p>

<p>"To be married, I suppose you mean?"</p>

<p>"Thank heaven, no! To a Princess."</p>

<p>"Dear me, one would think you were a man hater!"</p>

<p>"So I am, a <i>one</i>-man hater. What Simpkins is to you,
that man is to me. And that's why I'm on my way
to Cannes to be the companion of the Princess Boriskoff,
who's said to be rather deaf and very quick-tempered, as
well as elderly and a great invalid. She sheds her paid
companions as a tree sheds its leaves in winter. I hear
that Europe is strewn with them."</p>

<p>"Nice prospect for you!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it? But beggars mustn't be choosers."</p>

<p>"You don't look much like a beggar."</p>

<p>"Because I can make my own dresses and hats&mdash;and
nightgowns."</p>

<p>"Well, if your Princess sheds you, let me know, and
you may live yet to deliver me from Simpkins. I feel
you'd be equal to it! My address is&mdash;but I'll give
you a card." And, burrowing under her pillow, she
unearthed a fat handbag from which, after some fumbling,
she presented me with a visiting-card, enamelled in an
old-fashioned way. I read: "Miss Paget, 34a Eaton
Square. Broomlands House, Surrey."</p>

<p>"Now you're not to lose that," she impressed upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>me. "Write if you're scattered over Europe by this
Russian (I never did believe much in Princesses, excepting,
of course, our <i>own</i> dear Royalties), or if you ever come
to England. Even if it's years from now, I assure you
Beau and I won't have forgotten you. As for your
address&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I haven't any," I said. "At present I'm depending
on the Princess for one. She's at the Hotel Majestic
Palace, Cannes; but from what my friend Pam&mdash;the
Comtesse de Nesle&mdash;says, I fancy she doesn't stop long
in any town. It was the Comtesse de Nesle who got me
the place. She's the only one who knows where I'm
going, because&mdash;after a fashion, I'm running away to
be the Princess's companion."</p>

<p>"Running away from the Man?"</p>

<p>"Yes; also from my relatives who're sure it's my duty
to be <i>his</i> companion. So you see I can't give you their
address. I've ceased to have any right to it. And
now I really think I <i>had</i> better go back to bed."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>At half-past ten this morning we parted, the
best of friends, and I dropped a good-bye kiss
into the deep black gorge between the promontories
of Beau's velvet forehead and plush nose.</p>

<p>We'd had breakfast together, Miss Paget and I, to
say nothing of the dog, and I felt rather cheerful. Of
course I dreaded the Princess; but I always did like
adventures, and it appeared to me distinctly an adventure
to be a companion, even in misery. Besides, it was nice to
have come away from Monsieur Charretier, and to feel
that not only did he not know where I was, but that he
wasn't likely to find out. Poor me! I little guessed what
an adventure on a grand scale I was in for. Already this
morning seems a long time ago; a year at the Convent
used to seem shorter.</p>

<p>I drove up to the hotel in the omnibus which was at
the station, and asked at the office for the Princess
Boriskoff. I said that I was Mademoiselle d'Angely, and
would they please send word to the Princess, because
she was expecting me.</p>

<p>It was a young assistant manager who received me,
and he gave me a very queer, startled sort of look when
I said this, as if I were a suspicious person, and he didn't
quite know whether it would be better to answer me or
call for help.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>"I haven't made a mistake, have I?" I asked, beginning
to be anxious. "This <i>is</i> the hotel where the Princess
is staying, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"She was staying here," the youth admitted.
"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has she <i>gone</i>?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly."</p>

<p>"She must be either here or gone."</p>

<p>Again he regarded me with suspicion, as if he did not
agree with my statement.</p>

<p>"Are you a relative of the Princess?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"No, I'm engaged to be her companion."</p>

<p>"Oh! If that is all! But perhaps, in any case, it will
be better to wait for the manager. He will be here
presently. I do not like to take the responsibility."</p>

<p>"The responsibility of what?" I persisted, my heart
beginning to feel like a patter of rain on a tin roof.</p>

<p>"Of telling you what has happened."</p>

<p>"If something has happened, I can't wait to hear it.
I must know at once," I said, with visions of all sorts of
horrid things: that the Princess had decided not to have
a companion, and was going to disown me; that my
cousin Madame Milvaine had somehow found out everything;
that Monsieur Charretier had got on my track,
and was here in advance waiting to pounce upon me.</p>

<p>"It is a thing which we do not want to have talked
about in the hotel," the young man hesitated.</p>

<p>"I assure you I won't talk to any one. I don't know
any one to talk to."</p>

<p>"It is very distressing, but the Princess Boriskoff died
about four o'clock this morning, of heart failure."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>"Oh!" ... I could not get out another word.</p>

<p>"These things are not liked in hotels, even when not
contagious."</p>

<p>The assistant manager looked gloomily at me, as if
I might be held responsible for the inconvenient event;
but still I could not speak.</p>

<p>"Especially in the high season. It is being kept
secret. That is the custom. In some days, or less, it
will leak out, but not till the Princess has&mdash;been removed.
You will kindly not mention it, mademoiselle. This
is very bad for us."</p>

<p>No, I would kindly not mention it, but it was worse
for me than for them. The Hotel Majestic Palace looked
rich; very, very rich. It had heaps of splendid mirrors
and curtains, and imitation Louis XVI. sofas, and everything
that a hotel needs to make it happy and successful,
while I had nothing in the world except what I stood up
in, one fitted bag, one small box, and thirty-two francs.
I didn't quite see, at first sight, what I was to do; but
neither did the assistant manager see what that had to
do with him.</p>

<p>Once I knew a girl who was an actress, and on tour
in the country she nearly drowned herself one day. When
the star heard of it, he said: "How <i>should</i> we have
played to-night if you'd been dead&mdash;without an understudy,
too?"</p>

<p>At this moment I knew just how the girl must have
felt when the star said that.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think I must stay here a day or two, until I can&mdash;arrange
things," I managed to stammer. "Have you a
small single room disengaged?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>"We have one or two small north rooms which are
usually occupied by valets and maids," the young man
informed me. "They are twelve francs a day."</p>

<p>"I'll take one," I replied. And then I added anxiously:
"Have any relatives of the Princess come?"</p>

<p>"None have come; and certainly none will come, as
it would now be too late. Her death was very sudden.
The Princess's maid knows what to do. She is an elderly
woman, experienced. The suite occupied by Her Highness
will be free to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh! And had she no friends here?"</p>

<p>"I do not think the Princess was a lady who made
friends. She was very proud and considered herself
above other people. Would you like to see your room,
mademoiselle? I will send some one to take you up to it.
It will be on the top floor."</p>

<p>I was in a mood not to care if it had been on the roof, or
in the cellar. I hardly knew where I was going, as a few
minutes later a still younger youth piloted me across a
large square hall toward a lift; but I was vaguely conscious
that a good many smart-looking people were sitting
or standing about, and that they glanced at me as I went
by. I hoped dimly that I didn't appear conspicuously
pale and stricken.</p>

<p>Just in front of the lift door a tall woman was talking
to a little man. There was an instant of delay while my
guide and I waited for them to move, and before they
realized that we were waiting.</p>

<p>"They say the poor thing is no worse than yesterday,
however, my maid tells me&mdash;" The lady
had begun in a low, mysterious tone, but broke off
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>suddenly when it dawned upon her that she was obstructing the way.</p>

<p>I knew instinctively <i>who</i> was the subject of the whispered
conversation, and I couldn't help fixing my eyes almost
appealingly on the tall woman; for though she was middle-aged
and not pretty, her voice was so nice and she looked
so kind that I felt a longing to have her for a friend.
She had probably been acquainted with Princess Boriskoff,
I said to myself, or she would not be talking of her now,
with bated breath, as a "poor thing."</p>

<p>Evidently the lady had been waiting for the lift to come
down, for when my guide rang and it descended she took
a step forward, giving a friendly little nod to her companion,
and saying, "Well, I must go. I feel sure it's
<i>true</i> about her."</p>

<p>Then, instead of sailing ahead of me into the lift, as she
had a perfect right to do, being much older and far more
important than I, and the first comer as well, she hesitated
with a pleasant half smile, as much as to say, "You're a
stranger. I give up my right to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, please!" I said, stepping aside to let her pass,
which she did, making room for me to sit down beside
her on the narrow plush-covered seat. But I didn't care
to sit. I was so crushed, it seemed that, if once I sat
down I shouldn't have courage to rise up again and
wrestle with the difficulties of life.</p>

<p>The lady got out on the second floor, throwing back a
kindly glance, as if she took a little interest in me, and
wanted me to know it. I suppose it must have been
because I was tired and nervous after a whole night
without sleep that the shock I'd just received was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>too much for me. Anyway, that kind glance made a lump
rise in my throat, and the lump forced tears into my
eyes. I looked down instantly, so that she shouldn't see
them and think me an idiot, but I was afraid she did.</p>

<p>The young man who was taking me up to the top floor,
and treating me rather nonchalantly because I was a
North Roomer and a Twelve Francer, waved the lift boy
aside to open the door himself for the lady; so that I knew
she must be considered a person worth conciliating.</p>

<p>Shut up in my ten-by-six-foot room, I tried to compose
myself and make plans; but to make plans on thirty-two
francs, when you've no home, and would be far from it
even if you had one; when you've nobody to help you,
and wouldn't want to ask them if you had&mdash;is about as
hard as to play the piano brilliantly without ever having
taken a lesson. With Princess Boriskoff dead, with
Pamela de Nesle sailing for New York to-morrow morning,
and no other intimate friends rich enough to do anything
for me, even if they were willing to help me fly in the face
of Providence and Madame Milvaine, it did seem (as
Pamela herself would say) as though I were rather "up
against it."</p>

<p>The thought of Miss Paget suddenly jumped into my
head, and the wish that, somehow, I had kept her up my
sleeve as a last resort, in case she really were in earnest
about her offer. But she hadn't told me where she was
going in Italy, and it would be of no use writing to one
of her English addresses, as I couldn't stop on where I was,
waiting for an answer.</p>

<p>Altogether things were very bad with me.</p>

<p>After I had sat down and thought for a while, I rang,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>and asked for the housekeeper. A hint or two revealed
that she was aware of what had happened, and, explaining
that I was to have been Princess Boriskoff's companion, I
said that I must see the Princess's maid. She must come
to my room. I must have a talk with her.</p>

<p>Presently, after an interval which may have been meant
to emphasize her dignity, appeared a pale, small Russian
woman whose withered face was as tragic and remote from
the warmth of daily life as that of the eldest Fate.</p>

<p>She could speak French, and we talked together. Yes,
her mistress had died very suddenly, but she and the
doctors had always known that it might happen so, at any
moment. It was hard for me, but&mdash;what would you?
Life was hard. It might have been that I would have
found life hard with Her Highness. What was to be,
would be. I must write to my friends. It was not in her
power to do anything for me. Her Highness had left
no instructions. These things happened. Well! one
made the best of them. There was nothing more to say.</p>

<p>So we said nothing more, and the woman moved away
silently, as if to funeral music, to prepare for her journey
to Russia. I&mdash;went down to luncheon.</p>

<p>One always does go down to luncheon while one is still
inclined to keep up appearances before oneself; but the
restaurant was large and terribly magnificent, with a
violent rose-coloured carpet, and curtains which made me,
in my frightened pallor, with my pale yellow hair and my
gray travelling dress, feel like a poor little underground
celery-stalk flung into a sunlit strawberry-bed, amid a
great humming of bees.</p>

<p>The vast rosy sea was thickly dotted with many small
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>table-islands that glittered appetizingly with silver and
glass; but I could not have afforded to acknowledge an
appetite even if I'd had one.</p>

<p>My conversation with the Russian woman had made
me rather late. Most of the islands were inhabited, and
as I was piloted past them by a haughty head waiter I
heard people talking about golf, tennis, croquet, bridge,
reminding me that I was in a place devoted to the pursuit of
pleasure.</p>

<p>The most desirable islands were next the windows,
therefore the one at which I dropped anchor (for I'd
changed from a celery-stalk into a little boat now) was
exactly in the middle of the room, with no view save of
faces and backs of heads.</p>

<p>One of the faces was that of the lady who had gone up
with me in the lift; and now and then, from across the
distance that separated us, I saw her glance at me. She
sat alone at a table that had beautiful roses on it, and she
read a book as she ate.</p>

<p>One ordered here <i>&agrave; la carte</i>: there was no <i>d&eacute;jeuner &agrave;
prix fixe</i>; and it took courage to tell a waiter who looked
like a weary young duke that I would have <i>consomm&eacute;</i> and
bread, with nothing, no, <i>nothing</i> to follow.</p>

<p>Oh! the look he gave me, as if I had annexed the table
under false pretences!</p>

<p>Suddenly the chorus of an American song ran with
mocking echoes through my brain. I had heard Pamela
sing it at the Convent:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The waiter roared it through the hall:</p>
<p class="i0">"We don't give bread with <i>one</i> fish-ball!</p>
<p class="i0">We-don't-<i>give</i>-bread with one fish-<i>ba-a-ll</i>!"</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>I half expected some such crushing protest, and it was
only when the weary duke had turned his back, presumably
to execute my order, that I sank into my chair with a
sigh of relief after strain.</p>

<p>Just at that moment I met the eye of the lady of the lift,
and when the waiter reappeared with a small cup, on a
charger large enough to have upheld the head of John the
Baptist, she looked again. In five minutes I had finished
the <i>consomm&eacute;</i>, and it became painful to linger. Rising,
I made for the door, which seemed a mile away, and I did
not lift my head in passing the table where the lady sat
behind her roses. I heard a rustling as I went by, however,
a crisp rustling like flower-leaves whispering in a breeze,
or a woman's silk ruffles stroking each other, which followed
me out into the hall.</p>

<p>Then the pleasant voice I had heard near the lift spoke
behind me:</p>

<p>"Won't you have your coffee with me in the garden?"</p>

<p>I could hardly believe at first that it was for me the
invitation was intended, but turning with a little start, I
saw it repeated in a pair of gentle gray eyes set rather
wide apart in a delicate, colourless face.</p>

<p>"Oh! thank you!" I hesitated. "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do forgive me," went on the lady, "but your face
interested me this morning, and as we're all rather curious
about strangers&mdash;we idle ones here&mdash;I took the liberty
of asking the manager who you were. He told me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About the Princess?" I asked, when she paused as if
slightly embarrassed.</p>

<p>"He told me that you said you had come to Cannes to be
her companion. He didn't tell me she was dead, poor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>woman, but&mdash;there are some things one knows by
instinct, by intuition, aren't there? And then&mdash;I
couldn't help seeing, or perhaps only imagining, that you
looked sad and worried. You are very young, and are
here all alone, and so&mdash;I thought perhaps you wouldn't
mind my speaking to you?"</p>

<p>"I'm very grateful," I said, "for your interest. And
it's so good of you to ask me to have coffee with you."
(I was almost sure, too, that she had hurried away in
the midst of her luncheon to do this deed of kindness.)</p>

<p>"Perhaps, after all, you'll come with me to my own
sitting-room," she suggested. "We can talk more quietly
there; and though the garden's quite lovely, it's rather
too glaring at this time of day."</p>

<p>We went up in the lift together, and the moment she
opened the door of her sitting-room I saw that she had
contrived to make it look like herself. She talked only
about her books and photographs and flowers until the
coffee had come, and we seemed better acquainted. Then
she told me that she was Lady Kilmarny&mdash;"Irish in
every drop in her veins"; and presently set herself to
draw me out.</p>

<p>I began by making up my mind not to pour forth all
my troubles, lest she should think that I wanted to take
advantage of her kindness and sponge upon her for help;
but she was irresistible, as only a true Irishwoman can be,
and the first thing I knew, I had emptied my heart of
its worries.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>"You will have to go back to the cousins you've
been living with in Paris," pronounced Lady
Kilmarny. "You're much too young and
pretty to be <i>anywhere</i> alone."</p>

<p>"I can't go on living with them unless I promise to
marry Monsieur Charretier," I explained. "I'd rather
scrub floors than marry Monsieur Charretier."</p>

<p>"You'd never finish one floor. The second would
finish you. I thought French girls&mdash;well, then, <i>half</i>
French girls&mdash;usually let their people arrange their
marriages."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'm not usual. I <i>hope</i> Monsieur Charretier isn't."</p>

<p>"Is he such a monster?"</p>

<p>"He is fat, especially in all the places he oughtn't to
be fat. And old. But worse than his <i>embonpoint</i> and
his nose, he made his money in&mdash;you could never guess."</p>

<p>"I see by your face, my poor child: it was Liver Pills."</p>

<p>"Something far more dreadful."</p>

<p>"Are there lower depths?"</p>

<p>"There are&mdash;Corn Plasters."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, you are <i>quite</i> right! You couldn't marry him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>"Thank you so much! Then, I can't go back to my
cousins. They&mdash;they take Monsieur Charretier
seriously. I think they even take his plasters&mdash;gratuitously."</p>

<p>"Is he so very rich?"</p>

<p>"But disgustingly rich. He has an awful, bulbous
new ch&acirc;teau in the country, with dozens of incredibly
high-powered motor-cars; and in the most expensive
part of Paris a huge apartment wriggling from floor to
ceiling with <i>Nouveau Art</i>. The girl who marries him will
have to be smeared with diamonds, and know the most
appalling people. In fact, she'll have to be a kind of
walking, pictorial advertisement for the success of Charretier's
Corn Plasters."</p>

<p>"He must know some nice people, since he knows
relations of yours."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the compliment, which I hope you
pay me on circumstantial evidence. But it's deceiving.
My mother, I believe, was the only nice person in her
family. These cousins, husband and wife, brought
mamma to Europe to live with them when she was a young
girl, quite rich and an orphan. They were furious when
she fell in love with papa, who was only a lieutenant with
nothing but a very old name, the ruins of a castle that
tourists paid francs to see, and a ramshackle house in
Paris almost too dilapidated to let. It was a mere detail
to them that he happened to be one of the best-looking and
most agreeable young men in the world. They did nothing
but say, 'I told you so!' for years, whenever anything
disastrous happened&mdash;as it constantly did, for poor
papa and mamma loved each other so much, and had so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>much fun, that they couldn't have time to be business-like.
My cousins thought everything mamma did was
a madness&mdash;such as sending me to the most fashionable
convent school in France. As if I hadn't to be educated!
And then, when the castle fell so to bits that tourists
wouldn't bother with it any more, and nobody but rats
would live in the Paris house unless it was repaired&mdash;and
poor papa was killed in a horrid little Saturday-to-Monday
war of no importance (except to people whose
hearts it broke)&mdash;oh! I believe the cousins were glad!
They thought it was a judgment. That happened
years ago, when I was only fifteen, and though they've
plenty of money (more than most people in the American
colony) they didn't offer to help; and mamma would
have died sooner than ask. I had to be snatched out of
school, to find that all the beautiful dreams of being a
happy <i>d&eacute;butante</i> must go by contraries. We lived in the
tumble-down house ourselves, mamma and I, and her
friends rallied round her&mdash;she was so popular and
pretty. They got her chances to give singing lessons,
and me to do translating, and painting <i>menus</i>. We were
happy again, after a while, in spite of all, and people were
so good to us! Mamma used to hold a kind of <i>salon</i>,
with all the brightest and best crowding to it, though
they got nothing but sweet biscuits, <i>vin ordinaire</i>, and
conversation&mdash;and besides, the house might have taken
a fancy to fall down on their heads any minute. It was
sporting of them to come at all!"</p>

<p>"And the cousins. Did they come?"</p>

<p>"Not they! They're of the society of the little Brothers
and Sisters of the Rich. Their set was quite different
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>from ours. But when mamma died nearly two years
ago, and I was alone, they did call, and Cousin Emily
offered me a home. I was to give up all my work, of
course, which she considered degrading, and was simply
to make myself useful to her as a daughter of the
house might do. That was what she <i>said</i>."</p>

<p>"You accepted?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I didn't know her and her husband as well as
I do now; and before she died mamma begged me to go
to them, if they asked me. That was when Monsieur
Charretier came on the scene&mdash;at least, he came a few
months later, and I've had no peace since. Lately,
things were growing more and more impossible, when my
best friend, Comtesse de Nesle, came to my rescue and
found (or thought she'd found) me this engagement with
the Princess. As I told you, I simply ran away&mdash;<i>sneaked</i>
away&mdash;and came here without any one but Pamela
knowing. And now she&mdash;the Comtesse&mdash;is just sailing
for New York with her husband."</p>

<p>"The Comtesse de Nesle&mdash;that pretty little American!
I've met her in Paris&mdash;and at the Dublin Horse Show,"
exclaimed Lady Kilmarny. "Well, I wish I could take
up the rescue work where she has laid it down. I think
you are a most romantic little figure, and I'd love to
engage you as my companion, only my husband and I
are as poor as church mice. Like your father, we've
nothing but our name and a few ruins. When I come
South for my health I can't afford such luxuries as a
husband and a maid. I have to choose between them and
a private sitting-room. So you see, I can't possibly
indulge in a companion."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>People seemed to be always wanting me as one, and
then reluctantly abandoning me!</p>

<p>"Your kindness and sympathy have helped me a lot," said I.</p>

<p>"They won't pay your way."</p>

<p>"I have no way. So far as I can see, I shall have to
stop in Cannes, anonymously so to speak, for the rest of
my life."</p>

<p>"Where would you like to go, if you could choose&mdash;since
you can't go to your relations?"</p>

<p>Again my thoughts travelled after Miss Paget, as if
she had been a fat, red will-o'-the-wisp.</p>

<p>"To England, perhaps," I answered. "In a few weeks
from now I might be able to find a position there."
And I went on to tell, in as few words as possible, my
adventure in the railway train.</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Lady Kilmarny. "We'll look her up in
<i>Who's Who</i>, and see if she exists. If she's anybody,
she'll be there. And <i>Who's Who</i> I always have with me,
abroad. One meets so many pretenders, it's quite
dangerous."</p>

<p>"How can you tell I'm not one?" I asked. "Yet
you spoke to me."</p>

<p>"Why, you're down in a kind of invisible book, called
'You're You.' It's sufficient reference for me. Besides,
if your two eyes couldn't be trusted, it would be easy to
shed you."</p>

<p>Lady Kilmarny said this smilingly, as she found the red
book, and passed her finger down the columns of P's.</p>

<p>"Yes, here's the name, and the two addresses on the
visiting-card. She's the Honourable Maria Paget, only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>daughter of the late Baron Northfield. Yes, an
engagement with her would be safe, if not agreeable. But how
to get you to England?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I could go as somebody's maid," I reflected aloud.</p>

<p>She looked at me sharply. <i>"Would</i> you do that?"</p>

<p>"It would be better than being an advertisement for
Corn Plasters," I smiled.</p>

<p>"Then," said Lady Kilmarny, "perhaps, after all, I
can help you. But no&mdash;I should never dare to suggest
it! The thought of a girl like you&mdash;it would be too
dreadful."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>When my father had been extravagant, he
used to say gaily in self-defence that "one
owed something to one's ancestors."
Certainly, if it had not been for several of his ancestors,
he would not have owed so much to his contemporaries.
But in spite of their agreeable vices, or because of them, I
was brought up in the cult of ancestor worship, as
religiously as if I had been Chinese.</p>

<p>To be a d'Angely was a privilege, in our eyes, which
not only supplied gilding for the gingerbread, but for
the most economical substitutes.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0" style="margin-left:0em;"><i>"Ne roi je suis,</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>Ne prince aussi,</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>Je suis le Sire d'Angely,"</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>calmly remarked the gentleman of Louis XI.'s time,
who became famous for hanging as many retainers as he
liked, and defending his action by originating the
family motto.</p>

<p>Mother also had ancestors who began to take
themselves seriously somewhere about the time of the
<i>Mayflower</i>, though for all we know they may have secured
their passage in the steerage.</p>

<p>"A Courtenay can do anything," was their rather
ambiguous motto, which suggested that it might have been
started in self-defence, if not as a boast; and it (the name,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>not the motto) had been thoughtfully sandwiched in
between my Lys and my d'Angely by my sponsors in
baptism, that if necessary I might ever have an excuse at
hand for any dark deed or infra dig-ness.</p>

<p>I used often to murmur the consoling mottoes to myself
when pattering through muddy streets, too poor to take
an omnibus, on the way to sell&mdash;or try to sell&mdash;my
translations or my <i>menus</i>. But now, after all that's
happened, if it is to strike conviction to my soul, I shall
be obliged to yell it at the top of my mental lungs.</p>

<p>(That expression may sound ridiculous, but it isn't.
We could not talk to ourselves as we do, in all kinds of
voices, high or low, if we hadn't mental lungs, or at the
least, sub-conscious-self lungs.)</p>

<p><i>Je suis</i> the daughter of the last Sire d'Angely; and
a Courtenay can do anything; so of course it's all right;
and it's no good my ancestors turning in their graves,
for they'll only make themselves uncomfortable without
changing my mind.</p>

<p>I, Lys d'Angely, am going to be a lady's-maid; or
rather, I am going to be the maid of an extremely rich
person who calls herself a lidy.</p>

<p>It's perfectly awful, or awfully comic, according to
the point of view, and I swing from one to the other,
pushed by my fastidiousness to my sense of humour, and
back again, in a way to make me giddy. But it's
settled. I'm going to do it. I had almost to drag the
suggestion out of Lady Kilmarny, who turned red and
stammered as if I were the great lady, she the poor young
girl in want of a situation.</p>

<p>There was, said she, a quaint creature in the hotel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
(one met these things abroad, and was obliged to be more
or less civil to them) who resembled Monsieur Charretier
in that she was disgustingly rich. It was not Corn
Plasters. It was Liver Pills, the very same liver pills
which had dropped into the mind of Lady Kilmarny
when I hesitated to put into words the foundation of my
<i>pretendant's</i> future. It was the Liver Pills which had
eventually introduced into her brain the idea she
falteringly embodied for me.</p>

<p>The husband of the quaint creature had invented the
pills, even as Monsieur Charretier had invented his
abomination. Because of the pills he had been made a Knight;
at least, Lady Kilmarny didn't know any other reason.
He was Sir Samuel Turnour (evolved from Turner),
just married for the second time to a widow in whose
head it was like the continual frothing of new wine to
be "her ladyship."</p>

<p>Lady Turnour had lately quarrelled with a maid and
dismissed her, Lady Kilmarny told me. Now, she was in
immediate need of another, French (because French maids
are fashionable) able to speak English, because the
Turnour family had as yet mastered no other language. Lady
Kilmarny believed that this was the honeymoon of the
newly married pair, and that, after having paused
on the wing at Cannes, for a little billing and cooing,
they intended to pursue their travels in France for
some weeks, before returning to settle down in England.
"Her Ladyship" was asking everybody with whom
she had contrived to scrape acquaintance (especially
if they had titles) to recommend her a maid. Lady
Kilmarny, as a member of the League against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Cruelty to Animals, had determined that nothing
would induce her to throw any poor mouse to this cat,
even if she heard of a mouse plying for hire; but here was
I in a dreadful scrape, professing myself ready to snap at
anything except Corn Plasters; and she felt bound to
mention that the mousetrap was open, the cheese waiting
to be nibbled.</p>

<p>"Do you think she'd have me?" I asked&mdash;"the
quaint creature, her ladyship?"</p>

<p>"Only too likely that she would," said Lady Kilmarny.
"But remember, the worst is, she doesn't <i>know</i> she's
a quaint creature. She is quite happy about herself,
offensively happy, and would consider you the 'creature.'
A truly awful person, my dear. A man in this hotel&mdash;the
little thing you saw me talking to this morning, knows
all about them both. I think they began in Peckham or
somewhere. They <i>would</i>, you know, and call it 'S.W.'
She was a chemist's daughter, and he was the humble
assistant, long before the Pill materialized, so she refused
him, and married a dashing doctor. But unfortunately
he dashed into the bankruptcy court, and afterward she
probably nagged him to death. Anyway he died&mdash;but
not till long after Sam Turner had taken pity on some
irrelevant widow, as his early love was denied him. The
widow had a boy, to whom the stepfather was good&mdash;(really
a very decent person according to his lights!) and
kept on making pills and millions, until last year he lost
his first wife and got a knighthood. The old love was a
widow by this time, taking in lodgers in some neighbourhood
where you <i>do</i> take lodgers, and Sir Samuel found
and gathered her like a late rose. Naturally she puts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>on all the airs in the world, and diamonds in the morning.
She'll treat you like the dirt under her feet, because that's
her conception of her part&mdash;and yours. But I'll introduce
you to her if you like."</p>

<p>After a little reflection, I did like; but as it seemed to
me that there'd better not be two airs in the family, I
said that I'd put on none at all, and make no pretensions.</p>

<p>"She's the kind that doesn't know a lady or gentleman
without a label," my kind friend warned me. "You
must be prepared for that."</p>

<p>"I'll be prepared for anything," I assured her. But
when it came to the test, I wasn't quite.</p>

<p>Lady Kilmarny wrote a line to Lady Turnour, and
asked if she might bring a maid to be interviewed&mdash;a
young woman whom she could recommend. The note
was sent down to the bride (who of course had the best
suite in the hotel, on the first floor) and presently an
answer came&mdash;saying that Her Ladyship would be
pleased to receive Lady Kilmarny and the person in
question.</p>

<p>Suddenly I felt that I must go alone. "Please leave
me to my fate," I said. "I should be too self-conscious
if you were with me. Probably I should laugh in her
face, or do something dreadful."</p>

<p>"Very well," Lady Kilmarny agreed. "Perhaps
you're right. Say that I sent you, and that, though
you've never been with me, friends of mine know all
about you. You might tell her that you were to have
travelled with the Princess Boriskoff. That will impress
her. She would kiss the boot of a Princess. Afterward,
come up and tell me how you got on with 'Her Ladyship.'"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>I was stupid to be nervous, and told myself so; but as
I knocked at the door of the suite reserved for Millionaires
and other Royalties, my heart was giving little
ineffective jumps in my breast, like&mdash;as my old nurse
used to say&mdash;"a frog with three legs."</p>

<p>"Come in!" called a voice with sharp, jagged edges.</p>

<p>I opened the door. In a private drawing-room as
different as the personality of one woman from another,
sat Lady Turnour. She faced me as I entered, so I had
a good look at her, before casting down my eyes and
composing my countenance to the self-abnegating meekness
which I conceived fitting to a <i>femme de chambre
comme il faut</i>.</p>

<p>She was enthroned on a sofa. One could hardly say
less, there was so much of her, and it was all arranged as
perfectly as if she were about to be photographed. No
normal woman, merely sitting down, with no other object
than to be comfortable, would curve the tail of her gown
round in front of her like a sickle; or have just the
point of one shoe daintily poised on a footstool; or the sofa-cushions
at exactly the right angle behind her head to
make a background; or the finger with all her best rings
on it, keeping the place in an English illustrated journal.</p>

<p>I dared not believe that she had posed for me. It
must have been for Lady Kilmarny; and that I alone
should see the picture was a bad beginning.</p>

<p>She is of the age when a woman can still tell people
that she is forty, hoping they will exclaim politely,
"Impossible!"</p>

<p>It is not enough for her to be a Ladyship and a millionairess.
She will be a beauty as well, or at all costs she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>will be looked at. To that end are her eyebrows and
lashes black as jet, her undulated hair crimson, her lips
a brighter shade of the same colour, and her skin of
magnolia pallor, like the heroines of the novels which are
sure to be her favourites. Once, she must have been
handsome, a hollyhock queen of a kitchen-garden kingdom;
but she would be far more attractive now if only she
had "abdicated," as nice middle-aged women say in
France.</p>

<p>Her dress was the very latest dream of a neurotic Parisian
modiste, and would have been seductive on a slender girl.
On her&mdash;well, at least she would have her wish in it&mdash;she
would not pass unnoticed!</p>

<p>She looked surprised at sight of me, and I saw she
didn't realize that I was the expected candidate.</p>

<p>"Lady Kilmarny couldn't come," I began to explain,
"and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cut me short. "So you are the young
person she is recommending as a maid."</p>

<p>I corrected Miss Paget when she called me a "young
woman," but times have changed since then, and in future
I must humbly consent to be a young person, or even a
creature.</p>

<p>For a minute I forgot, and almost sat down. It would
have been the end of me if I had! Luckily I remembered
What I was, and stood before my mistress, trying to look
like Patience on a monument with butter in her mouth
which mustn't be allowed to melt.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" began the catechism (and the
word was "nime," according to Lady Turnour).</p>

<p>"N or M," nearly slipped out of my mouth, but I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>put Satan with all his mischief behind me, and answered
that I was Lys d'Angely.</p>

<p>"Oh, the surname doesn't matter. As you're a
French girl, I shall call you by your first name. It's
always done."</p>

<p>(The first time in history, I'd swear, that a d'Angely
was ever told his name didn't matter!)</p>

<p>"You seem to speak English very well for a French
woman?" (This almost with suspicion.)</p>

<p>"My mother was American."</p>

<p>"How extraordinary!"</p>

<p>(This was apparently a <i>tache</i>. Evidently lady's-maids
are expected <i>not</i> to have American mothers!)</p>

<p>"Let me hear your French accent."</p>

<p>I let her hear it.</p>

<p>"H'm! It seems well enough. Paris?"</p>

<p>"Paris, madame."</p>

<p>"Don't call me 'madame.' Any common person is
madame. You should say 'your ladyship'."</p>

<p>I said it.</p>

<p>"And I want you should speak to me in the third
person, like the French servants are supposed to do in
good houses."</p>

<p>"If mad&mdash;if your ladyship wishes."</p>

<p>(Thank heaven for a sense of humour! My one wild
desire was to laugh. Without that blessing, I should
have yearned to slap her.)</p>

<p>"What references have you got from your last situation?"</p>

<p>"I have never been in service before&mdash;my lady."</p>

<p>"My word! That's bad. However, you're on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>spot, and Lady Kilmarny recommends you. The poor
Princess was going to try you, it seems. I should think
she wouldn't have given much for a maid without any
experience."</p>

<p>"I was to have had two thousand francs a year as the
Princess's com&mdash;if the Princess was satisfied."</p>

<p>"Preposterous! I don't believe a word of it. Why,
what can you <i>do</i>? Can you dress hair? Can you make
a blouse?"</p>

<p>"I did my mother's hair, and sometimes my cousin's."</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> mother! <i>Your</i> cousin! I'm talking of a lidy."</p>

<p>My sense of humour <i>did</i> almost fail me just then.
But I caught hold of it by the tail just as it was darting
out of the window, spitting and scratching like a cross cat.</p>

<p>It was remembering Monsieur Charretier that brought
me to my bearings. "I think your ladyship would be
satisfied," I said. "And I make all my own dresses."</p>

<p>"That one you've got on?&mdash;which is <i>most</i> unsuitable
for a maid, I may tell you, and I should never permit it."</p>

<p>"This one I have on, also."</p>

<p>"I thought maybe it had been a present. Well, it's
<i>something</i> that you speak both English and French
passably well. I'll try you on Lady Kilmarny's recommendation,
if you want to come to me for fifty francs a
month. I won't give more to an <i>amateur</i>."</p>

<p>I thought hard for a minute. Lady Kilmarny had
said it would not be many weeks before the Turnours
went to England. There, if Miss Paget (who seemed
extremely nice by contrast and in retrospect) were still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>of the same mind, I might find a good home. If not,
she was as kind as she was queer, and would help me
look further. So I replied that I would accept the fifty
francs, and would do my best to please her ladyship.</p>

<p>She did not express herself as gratified. "You can
begin work this evening," she said. "I was obliged
to send away my last maid yesterday, and I'm <i>lost</i> without
one." (This was delightful from a "lidy" who had
kept lodgers for years, with the aid perhaps of one smudgy-nosed
"general"!) "But have you no more suitable
clothes? I can't let a maid of mine go flaunting about,
like a Mary-Jane-on-Sunday."</p>

<p>I mentioned a couple of plain black dresses in my
wardrobe, which might be made to answer if I were
allowed a few hours' time to work upon them, and didn't
add that they remained from my mourning for one
dearly loved.</p>

<p>"You can have till six o'clock free," said Lady Turnour.
"Then you must come back to lay out my things
for dinner, and dress me. What about your room? Had
the Princess taken something for you in the hotel?"</p>

<p>I evaded a direct answer by saying that I had a room;
and was inwardly thankful that, evidently, the Turnours
had not noticed me in the restaurant at luncheon, otherwise
things might have been awkward.</p>

<p>"Very well, you can keep the same one, then," went
on her ladyship, "and let the hotel people know it's
Sir Samuel who pays for it. To-morrow morning we
leave, in our sixty-horse-power motor car. We are making
a tour before going back to England. Sir Samuel's
stepson joins us in Paris or perhaps before and travels
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>on with us. He is staying now with some French people
of very high title, who live in a ch&acirc;teau. You will sit
on the front seat with the chauffeur."</p>

<p>This was a blow! I hadn't thought of the chauffeur.
"But," thought I, "chauffeur or no chauffeur, it's too late
now for retreat."</p>

<p>Talk of Prometheus with his vulture, the Spartan
boy with his decently concealed wolf! What of Lys
d'Angely with an English chauffeur in her pocket?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>When I was dismissed from the Presence, I
ran to Lady Kilmarny with my story, and
she agreed with me that the thing to dread
most in the whole situation was the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Of course he'll naturally consider himself on an
equality with you," she said, "and you'll have to eat
with him at hotels, and all that. Once, when my husband
and I were touring in France, and used to break
down near little inns, we were obliged to have a chauffeur
at the same table with us, because there was only one
long one (table, I mean, not chauffeur) and we couldn't
spare time to let him wait till we'd finished. My dear,
it was ghastly! You would never believe if you hadn't
seen it, how the creature swallowed his knife when he ate,
and did conjuring tricks with his fork and spoon. I
simply <i>dared</i> not look at him gnawing his bread, but
used to shut my eyes. I hate to distress you, poor child,
but I tell you these things as a warning. <i>Are</i> you able
to bear it?"</p>

<p>I said that I, too, could shut my eyes.</p>

<p>"You can't make a habit of doing so. And he may
want to put his arm round your waist, or chuck you
under the chin. I used to have complaints from my maid,
who was comparatively plain, while you&mdash;but I don't
want to frighten you. He <i>may</i> be different from our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>man. Some, they say, are most respectable. I love
common people when they're nice, and give up quite
pleasantly to being common; and of course Irish ones
are too delightful. But you can't hope for an Irish
chauffeur. I hear they don't exist. They're all French
or German or English. Let us hope this one may be the
father of a family."</p>

<p>It was well enough to be told to hope; and Lady
Kilmarny meant to be kind, but what she said made me
"creep" whenever I thought of the chauffeur.</p>

<p>She advised me not to take my meals with the maids
and valets at the Majestic Palace, because a change, so
sudden and Cinderella-like, after lunching in the restaurant,
would cause disagreeable talk in the hotel. As my
living in future would be at the charge of the Turnours, I
might afford myself a few indulgences to begin with, she
argued; and deciding that she was right, I made up my
mind to have my remaining meals served in my own room.</p>

<p>I hastily stripped a black frock of its trimming, dressed
my hair more simply even than usual, parted down the
middle, and altogether strove to achieve the air of a
<i>femme de chambre</i> born, not made. But I'm bound
to chronicle the fact for my own future reference (when
some day I shall laugh at this adventure) that the effect,
though restful to the eye, suggested the stage <i>femme de
chambre</i> rather than the sober reality one sees in every-day
life. However, I was conscious of having done my
best, a state of mind which always produces a cool,
strawberries-and-cream feeling in the soul; and thus
supported I tripped (yes, I <i>did</i> trip!) downstairs to adorn
Lady Turnour for dinner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>The door was open between her bedroom and the
sitting-room. Waiting in the former I could hear voices
in the latter. Lady Turnour and her husband were
talking about the arrival of the stepson whose name,
I soon gleaned from their conversation, is Herbert.
Naturally, it <i>would</i> be. People like that are always
named Herbert, and are familiarly known to those whom
they may concern as "Bertie."</p>

<p>Presently, her ladyship came into the bedroom, and
said, as a queen might say to her tirewoman, "Put me
into my dressing-gown." If there were a feminine word
for "sirrah," I think she would have liked to call me it.</p>

<p>My eye, roving distractedly, pounced upon a gold-embroidered,
purple silk kimono, perhaps more appropriate
to Pooh-Bah than to a stout English lady of the
lower middle class. I released it from its hook on the
door, and would that her ladyship had been as easy to
release from her bodice!</p>

<p>She had not one hook, but many; and they were all
so incredibly tight that, to put her into the dressing-gown
as ordered, I feared it would be necessary to melt and
pour her out of the gown she had on.</p>

<p>While I wrestled, silent and red faced, with a bodice
as snug as the head of a drum, the lord of all it contained
appeared in the doorway, and stopped, looking at me
in surprise.</p>

<p>He is common, too, this Sir Samuel, millionaire maker
of pills; but he is common in a good, almost pathetic
way, quite different from his wife's way&mdash;or Monsieur
Charretier's. He has stick-up gray hair curling all over
his round head, blue eyes, twinkling with a mild, yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>shrewd expression (which might be merry if encouraged
by her ladyship), and a large, slouching body with stooped
shoulders.</p>

<p>"What young lady have we here?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Not a young lady at all," explained his wife sharply.
"My new French maid."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, I'm sure," said Sir Samuel,
though it wasn't quite clear whether it was my forgiveness
or that of his spouse he craved, for his mistake in
supposing me to be a "young lady."</p>

<p>"What's her name?" he wanted to know, evidently
approving of me, if not as a maid, at least as a human
being.</p>

<p>"Something ridiculous in French that sounds like
'Liz,'" sniffed her ladyship. "But I shall call her Elise.
Also I shall expect her to stop dyeing her hair."</p>

<p>"But, madame, I do not dye it!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me. I know dyed hair when I see it."</p>

<p>(She ought to, having experience enough with her own!)</p>

<p>"Nature is the dyer, then," I ventured to persist,
piqued to self-defence by the certainty that her object
was to strip me of my wicked mask before her husband.</p>

<p>"I'm not used to being contradicted by my servants,"
her ladyship reminded me.</p>

<p>"My dear, do let the poor girl know whether she
dyes her hair or not." Sir Samuel pleaded for me with
more kindness than discretion. "I'm sure she speaks
beautiful English."</p>

<p>"As if that had anything to do with it! She may as
well understand, to begin with, that I won't put up with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>impudence and answering back. Hair that colour
doesn't go with dark eyes. And eyelashes like that
aren't suitable to lady's-maids."</p>

<p>"If your ladyship pleases, what am I to do with mine?"
I asked in the sweetest little voice; and I would have
given anything for someone to whom I might have telegraphed
a laugh.</p>

<p>"Wash the dark stuff off of them and let them be
light," were the simple instructions promptly returned
to me.</p>

<p>There was no more to be said, so I cast down the
offending features (are one's lashes one's features?)
and swallowed my feelings just as Lady Turnour will
have to swallow my hair and eyelashes if I'm to stop in
her service. If they stick in her throat, I suppose she
will discharge me. For a leopard cannot change his
spots, and a girl will not the colour of her locks and
lashes&mdash;when she happens to be fairly well satisfied
with Nature's work.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>Pamela's mother-in-law, <i>la Comtesse douairi&egrave;re</i>,
wears a lovely, fluffy white thing over her own
diminishing front hair, which I once heard her
describe, when struggling to speak English, as her "combination."
Pam and I laughed nearly to extinction, but I
didn't laugh this morning when I was obliged to help
Lady Turnour put on hers.</p>

<p>They say an emperor is no hero to his valet, and neither
can an empress be a heroine to her maid when she bursts
for the first time upon that humble creature's sight,
without her transformation.</p>

<p>It <i>did</i> make an unbelievable difference with her ladyship;
and it must have been a blow to poor Sir Samuel,
after all his years of hopeless love for a fond gazelle,
when at last he made that gazelle his own, and saw it
running about its bedroom with all its copper-coloured
"ondulations" naively lying on its dressing-table.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Paget's false front was one of those frank,
self-respecting old things one might have allowed one's
grandmother to wear, just as she would wear a cap; but
a transformation&mdash;well, one has perhaps believed in it,
if one has not the eye of a lynx, and the disillusion is
awful.</p>

<p>Of course, a lady's-maid is not a human being, and
what it is thinking matters no more than what thinks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>a chair when sat upon; so I don't suppose "her
ladyship" cared ten centimes for the impression I was
receiving and trying to digest in the first ten minutes
after my morning entrance.</p>

<p>As my hair waves naturally, I've scarcely more than
a bowing acquaintance with a curling-iron; but luckily
for me I always did Cousin Catherine's when she wanted
to look as beautiful as she felt; and though my hands
trembled with nervousness, I not only "ondulated" Lady
Turnour's transformation without burning it up, but
I added it to her own locks in a manner so deft as to make
me want to applaud myself.</p>

<p>Even she could find no fault. The effect was twice
as <i>chic</i> and becoming as that of yesterday. She looked
younger, and nearer to being the <i>grande dame</i> that she
burns to be. I saw various emotions working in her mind,
and attributed her silence on the subject of my personal
defects (unchanged despite her orders) to the success I was
making with her toilet. In her eyes, I began to take on
lustre as a Treasure not to be lightly thrown away on the
turn of a dye.</p>

<p>When she was dressed and painted to represent a
"lady motorist," it was my business to pack not only for
her but for Sir Samuel, who is the sort of man to be
miserable under the domination of a valet. There were
a round dozen of trunks, which had to be sent on by rail,
and there was also luggage for the automobile; such
ingenious and pretty luggage (bran new, like everything
of her ladyship's, not excepting her complexion) that
it was really a pleasure to pack it. As for the poor motor
maid, it was broken to her that she must, figuratively
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>speaking, live in a bag during the tour, and that bag
must have a place under her feet as she sat beside the
driver. It might make her as uncomfortable as it liked,
but whatever it did, it must on no account interfere with
the chauffeur.</p>

<p>We were supposed to start at ten, but a woman of Lady
Turnour's type doesn't think she's making herself of
enough importance unless she keeps people waiting.
She changed her mind three times about her veil, and
had her dressing-bag (a gorgeous affair, beside which
mine is a mere nutshell) reopened at the last minute to
get out different hatpins.</p>

<p>It was half-past ten when the luggage for the automobile
was ready to be taken away, and having helped
my mistress into her motoring coat, I left her saying
farewell to some hotel acquaintances she had scraped
up, and went out to put her ladyship's rugs into the car.</p>

<p>I had not seen it yet, nor the dreaded chauffeur, my
galley-companion; but as the front door opened, <i>voil&agrave;</i>
both; the car drawn up at the hotel entrance, the
chauffeur dangling from its roof.</p>

<p>Never did I see anything in the way of an automobile
so large, so azure, so magnificent, so shiny as to varnish,
so dazzling as to brass and crystal.</p>

<p>Perhaps the windows aren't really crystal, but they
were all bevelly and glittering in the sunshine, and seemed
to run round the car from back to front, giving the effect
of a Cinderella Coach fitted on to a motor. Never was
paint so blue, never was crest on carriage panel so large
and so like a vague, over-ripe tomato. Never was a
chauffeur so long, so slim, so smart, so leathery.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>He was dangling not because he fancied himself as a
tassel, but because he was teaching some last piece of
luggage to know its place on the roof it was shaped
to fit.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness, at least he's not fat, and won't
take up much room," I thought, as I stood looking at
the back of his black head.</p>

<p>Then he jumped down, and turned round. We gave
each other a glance, and he could not help knowing that
I must be her ladyship's maid, by the way I was loaded
with rugs, like a beast of burden. Of my face he could
see little, as I had on a thick motor-veil with a small
triangular talc window, which Lady Kilmarny had
given me as a present when I bade her good-bye. I had
the advantage of him, therefore, in the staring contest,
because his goggles were pushed up on the top of his
cap with an elastic, somewhat as Miss Paget's spectacles
had been caught in her false front.</p>

<p>His glance said: "Female thing, I've got to be bothered
by having you squashed into the seat beside me. You'd
better not be chatty with the man at the wheel, for if you
are, I shall have to teach you motor manners."</p>

<p>My glance, I sincerely hoped, said nothing, for I
hurriedly shut it off lest it should say too much, the
astonished thought in my mind being: "Why, Leather
Person, you look exactly like a gentleman! You have
the air of being the master, and Sir Samuel your
servant."</p>

<p>He really was a surprise, especially after Lady
Kilmarny's warning. Still, I at once began to tell
myself that chauffeurs <i>must</i> have intelligent faces. As
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>for this one's clear features, good gray eyes, brown skin,
and well-made figure, they were nothing miraculous,
since it is admitted that even a lower grade of beings,
grooms and footmen, are generally chosen as ornaments
to the establishments they adorn. Why shouldn't a
chauffeur be picked out from among his fellows to do
credit to a fine, sixty-horse-power blue motor-car?
Besides, a young man who can't look rather handsome
in a chauffeur's cap and neat leather coat and leggings
might as well go and hang himself.</p>

<p>The Leather Person opened the door of the car for me,
that I might put in the rugs. I murmured "thank you"
and he bowed. No sooner had I arranged my affairs,
and slipped the scent-bottle and bottle of salts, newly
filled, into a dainty little case under the window, when
Lady Turnour and Sir Samuel appeared.</p>

<p>I have met few, if any, queens in daily life, but I'm
almost sure that the Queen of England, for instance,
wouldn't consider it beneath her dignity to take some
notice of her chauffeur's existence if she were starting on
a motor tour. Lady Turnour was miles above it, however.
So far as she was concerned, one would have
thought that the car ran itself; that at sight of her and
Sir Samuel, the arbiters of its destiny, its heart began
to beat, its body to tremble with delight at the honour
in store for it.</p>

<p>"Tell him to shut the windows," said her ladyship,
when she was settled in her place. "Does he think
I'm going to travel on a day like this with all the wind
on the Riviera blowing my head off?"</p>

<p>The imperial order was passed on to "him," who was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>addressed as Bane, or Dane, or something of that ilk;
and I was sorry for poor Sir Samuel, whose face showed
how little he enjoyed the prospect of being cooped up in
a glass box.</p>

<p>"A day like this" meant that there was a wind which
no one under fifty had any business to know came out of
the east, for it arrived from a sky blue as a vast, inverted
cup of turquoise. The sea was a cup, too; a cup of gold
glittering where the Esterel mountains rimmed it, and
full to the frothing brim of blue spilt by the sky.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was a hint of keenness in the breeze,
and the palms in the hotel garden were whispering to
each other about it, while they rocked the roses tangled
among their fans; yet it seemed to me that the whispers
were not of complaint, but of joy&mdash;joy of life, joy of
beauty, and joy of the spring. The air smelled of a
thousand flowers, this air that Lady Turnour shunned
as if it were poison, and brought me a sense of happiness
and adventure fresh as the morning. I knew I had no
right to the feeling, because this wasn't my adventure.
I was only in it on sufferance, to oil the wheels of it, so
to speak, for my betters; yet golden joy ran through
all my veins as gaily, as generously, as if I were a princess
instead of a lady's-maid.</p>

<p>Why on earth I was happy, I didn't know, for it was
perfectly clear that I was going to have a horrid time;
but I pitied everybody who wasn't young, and starting
off on a motor tour, even if on fifty francs a month "all
found."</p>

<p>I pitied Lady Turnour because she was herself; I
pitied Sir Samuel because he was married to her; I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>pitied the people in the big hotel, who spent their afternoons
and evenings playing bridge with all the windows
hermetically sealed, while there was a world like this out
of doors; and I wasn't sure yet whether I pitied the
chauffeur or not.</p>

<p>He didn't look particularly sorry for himself, as he
took his seat on my right. I was well out of his way, and
he had the air of having forgotten all about me, as he
steered away from the hotel down the flower-bordered
avenue which led to the street.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," said I to myself, behind my little three-cornered
talc window, "whatever his faults may be,
appearances are <i>very</i> deceptive if he ever tries to chuck
me under the chin."</p>

<p>There we sat, side by side, shut away from our pastors
and masters by a barrier of glass, in that state of life and
on that seat to which it had pleased Providence to call
us, together.</p>

<p>"We're far enough apart in mind, though," I told
myself. Yet I found my thoughts coming back to the
man, every now and then, wondering if his nice brown
profile were a mere lucky accident, or if he were really
intelligent and well educated beyond his station. It
was deliciously restful at first to sit there, seeing beautiful
things as we flashed by, able to enjoy them in peace without
having to make conversation, as the ordinary <i>jeune
fille</i> must with the ordinary <i>jeune monsieur</i>.</p>

<p>"And is it that you love the automobilism, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"But yes, I love the automobilism. And you?"</p>

<p>"I also." (Hang it, what shall I say to her next?)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>"And the dust. It does not too much annoy you?"</p>

<p>(Oh, bother, I do wish he'd let me alone!)</p>

<p>"No, monsieur. Because there are compensations.
The scenery, is it not?"</p>

<p>"And for me your society." (What a little idiot
she is!)</p>

<p>And so on. And so on. Oh yes, there were consolations
in being a motor maid, sitting as far away as
possible from a cross-looking if rather handsome chauffeur,
who would want to bite her if she tried to do the
"society act."</p>

<p>But after a while, when we'd spun past the charming
villas and attractive shops of Cannes (which looks so
deceitfully sylvan, and is one of the gayest watering-places
in the world) silence began to be a burden.</p>

<p>It is such a nice motor car, and I did want to ask
intelligent questions about it!</p>

<p>I was almost sure they would be intelligent, because
already I know several things about automobiles. The
Milvaines haven't got one, but most of their friends in
Paris have, and though I've never been on a long tour
before, I've done some running about. When one knows
things, especially when one's a girl&mdash;a really well-regulated,
normal girl&mdash;one does like to let other people
know that one knows them. It's all well enough to
cram yourself full to bursting with interesting facts
which it gives you a vast amount of trouble to learn,
just out of respect for your own soul; and there's a great
deal in that point of view, in one's noblest moments;
but one's noblest moments are like bubbles, radiant
while they last, then going pop! quite to one's own surprise,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>leaving one all flat, and nothing to show for the late
bubble except a little commonplace soap.</p>

<p>Well, I am like that, and when I'm not nobly bubbling
I love to say what I'm thinking to somebody who will
understand, instead of feeding on myself.</p>

<p>It really was a waste of good material to see all that
lovely scenery slipping by like a panorama, and to be
having quite heavenly thoughts about it, which must slip
away too, and be lost for ever. I got to the pass when
it would have been a relief to be asked if "this were my
first visit to the Riviera;" because I could hastily have
said "Yes," and then broken out with a volley of
impressions.</p>

<p>Seeing beautiful things when you travel by rail consists
mostly on getting half a glimpse, beginning to exclaim,
"Oh, look <i>there</i>!" then plunging into the black gulf of a
tunnel, and not coming out again until after the best
bit has carefully disappeared behind an uninteresting,
fat-bodied mountain. But travelling by motor-car!
Oh, the difference! One sees, one feels; one is never,
never bored, or impatient to arrive anywhere. One
would enjoy being like the famous brook, and "go on
forever."</p>

<p>Other automobiles were ahead of us, other cars were
behind us, in the procession of Nomads leaving the South
for the North, but there had been rain in the night, so that
the wind carried little dust. My spirit sang when we
had left the long, cool avenue lined with the great silver-trunked
plane trees (which seemed always, even in sunshine,
to be dappled with moonlight) and dashed toward
the barrier of the Esterels that flung itself across our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>path. The big blue car bounded up the steep road,
laughing and purring, like some huge creature of the
desert escaped from a cage, regaining its freedom. But
every time we neared a curve it was considerate enough
to slow down, just enough to swing round with measured
rhythm, smooth as the rocking of a child's cradle.</p>

<p>Perhaps, thought I, the chauffeur wasn't cross, but
only concentrated. If I had to drive a powerful, untamed
car like this, up and down roads like that, I should certainly
get motor-car face, a kind of inscrutable, frozen
mask that not all the cold cream in the world could
ever melt.</p>

<p>I wondered if he resorted to cold cream, and before I
knew what I was doing, I found myself staring at the
statuesque brown profile through my talc triangle.</p>

<p>Evidently animal magnetism can leak through talc,
for suddenly the chauffeur glanced sharply round at me,
as if I had called him. "Did you speak?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Dear me, no, I shouldn't have dared," I hurried to
assure him. Again he transferred his attention from
the road to me, though only a fraction, and for only the
fraction of a second. I felt that he saw me as an eagle
on the wing might see a fly on a boulder toward which he
was steering between intervening clouds.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't you dare?" he wanted to know.</p>

<p>"One doesn't usually speak to lion-tamers while
they're engaged in taming," I murmured, quite surprised
at my audacity and the sound of my own voice.</p>

<p>The chauffeur laughed. "Oh!" he said.</p>

<p>"Or to captains of ocean liners on the bridge in thick
fogs," I went on with my illustrations.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>"What do you know about lion-tamers and captains
on ocean liners?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Nothing. But I imagine. I'm always doing a lot of imagining."</p>

<p>"Do you think you will while you're with Lady Turnour?"</p>

<p>"She hasn't engaged my brain, only my hands and feet."</p>

<p>"And your time."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank goodness it doesn't take time to imagine.
I can imagine all the most glorious things in heaven and
earth in the time it takes you to put your car at the next
corner."</p>

<p>He looked at me longer, though the corner seemed
dangerously near&mdash;to an amateur. "I see you've
learned the true secret of living," said he.</p>

<p>"Have I? I didn't know."</p>

<p>"Well, you have. You may take it from me. I'm
a good deal older than you are."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, all really polite men are older than the
women they're with."</p>

<p>"Even chauffeurs?"</p>

<p>It was my turn to laugh now. "A chauffeur with a lady's-maid."</p>

<p>"You seem an odd sort of lady's-maid."</p>

<p>"I begin to think you're an odd sort of chauffeur."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" I hesitated, though I knew why, perfectly.
"Aren't you rather abrupt in your questions? Suppose
we change the subject. You seem to have tamed this
tiger until it obeys you like a kitten."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>"That's what I get my wages for. But why do you
think I'm an odd sort of chauffeur?"</p>

<p>"For that matter, then, why do you think I'm an odd
lady's-maid?"</p>

<p>"As to that, probably I'm no judge. I never talked
to one except my mother's, and she&mdash;wasn't at all
like you."</p>

<p>"Well, that proves my point. The very fact that
your mother <i>had</i> a maid, shows you're an odd sort
of chauffeur."</p>

<p>"Oh! You mean because I wasn't always 'what I
seem,' and that kind of <i>Family Herald</i> thing? Do
you think it odd that a chauffeur should be by way of
being a gentleman? Why, nowadays the woods and
the story-books are full of us. But things are made
pleasanter for us in books than in real life. Out of books
people fight shy of us. A 'shuvvie' with the disadvantage
of having been to a public school, or handicapped by not
dropping his H's, must knock something off his screw."</p>

<p>"Are you really in earnest, or are you joking?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Half and half, perhaps. Anyway, it isn't a particularly
agreeable position&mdash;if that's not too big a
word for it. I envy you your imagination, in which you
can shut yourself up in a kind of armour against the
slings and arrows of outrageous fortune."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't envy me if you had to do Lady Turnour's
hair," I sighed.</p>

<p>The chauffeur laughed out aloud. "Heaven forbid!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I'm sure Sir Samuel would forbid, anyhow," said I.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>"Do you know, I don't think this trip's going to be
so bad?" said he.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," I murmured in my veil.</p>

<p>We both laughed a good deal then. But luckily the
glass was expensively thick, and the car was singing.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Something that it takes a little sense of humour to see,
when you've been down on your luck," said he.</p>

<p>"A sense of humour was the only thing my ancestors
left me," said I. "I don't wonder you laugh. It really
is quaintly funny."</p>

<p>"Do you think we're laughing at the same thing?"</p>

<p>"I'm almost sure of it."</p>

<p>"Do tell me your part, and let's compare notes."</p>

<p>"Well, it's something that nobody but us in this car&mdash;unless
it's the car itself&mdash;knows."</p>

<p>"Then it is the same thing. They haven't an idea
of it, and wouldn't believe it if anyone told them. Yes,
it is funny."</p>

<p>"About their not being&mdash;"</p>

<p>"While you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks. A lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A gentleman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the only ones on board&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are the two servants!"</p>

<p>"As long as <i>they</i> don't notice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And we do!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps we may get some fun out of it?"</p>

<p>"Extra&mdash;outside our wages. Would it be called a 'perquisite'?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>"If so, I'm sure we deserve it."</p>

<p>I sighed, thinking of her ladyship's transformation,
and lacing up her boots. "Well, there's a lot to make
up for."</p>

<p>And he gave me another look&mdash;a very nice look,
although he could see nothing of me but eyes and one
third of a nose. "If I can ever at all help to make up,
in the smallest way, you must let me try," he said.</p>

<p>I ceased to think that his profile was cross, or even stern.</p>

<p>I was glad that the chauffeur and I were in the same
box&mdash;I mean, the same car.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>All the same, I wondered a great deal how he
came there, and I hoped that he was wondering
the same sort of thing about me.
In fact, I laid myself out to produce such a result.
That is to say, I took some pains to show myself as
little like the common or parlour lady's-maid as possible.
I never took so much pains to impress any human
being, male or (far less) female, as I took to impress
that mere chauffeur&mdash;the very chauffeur I'd been
lying awake at night dreading as the most objectionable
feature in my new life.</p>

<p>All the nice things I'd thought of by the way, before we
introduced ourselves to each other, I trotted out (at least,
as many as I had presence of mind to remember); and
though I'm afraid he didn't pay me the compliment of
trying to "brill" in return, I told myself that it was not
because he didn't think me worth brilling for, but because
he's English. It never seems to occur to an Englishman
to "show off." I believe if Sir Samuel Turnour's chauffeur,
Mr. What's-his-name, knew twenty-seven languages,
he could be silent in all of them.</p>

<p>He did let me play the car's musical siren, though;
a fascinating bugbear, supposed to warn children, chickens,
and other light-minded animals that something
important is coming, and they'd better look alive. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>has two tunes, one grave, one gay. I suppose we would
use the grave one if the creature hadn't looked alive?</p>

<p>Although he didn't say much, the chauffeur (or "shuvvie"
as he scornfully names himself) knew all about
Robert Macaire and Caspard De Besse&mdash;knew more
about them than I, also their escapades on this
road over the Esterels, and in the mountain fastnesses,
when highwaymen were as fashionable as motor-cars
are now. I'd forgotten that it was this part of the world
where they earned their bread and fame; and was quite
thrilled to hear that the ghost of De Besse is supposed to
keep on, as a permanent residence, his old shelter cave
near the summit of strangely shaped Mont Vinaigre.
I'm sure, though, even if we'd passed his pitch at
midnight instead of midday, he wouldn't have dared
pop out and cry "Stand and deliver!" to a sixty-horsepower
Aigle.</p>

<p>I almost wished it were night, as we swooped over
mountain tops, our eyes plunging down the deep gorges,
and dropping with fearful joy over precipices, for the
effect would have been more solemn, more mysterious.
I could imagine that the fantastically formed rocks which
loomed above us or stood ranged far below would have
looked by moonlight like statues and busts of Titans,
carved to show poor little humanity such creatures as a
dead world had known. But it is hard for one's imagination
to do the best of which it feels capable when one
is dying for lunch.</p>

<p>Even the old "Murder Inn," which my companion
obligingly pointed out, didn't give me the thrill it ought,
because time was getting on when we flew past it, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
I would have been capable of eating vulgar bread and
cheese under its wickedly historic roof if I had been
invited.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they know anything about the road
and its history?" I asked the chauffeur, with a slight
gesture of my swathed head toward the solid wall of
glass which was our background.</p>

<p>"They? Certainly not, and don't want to know," he
answered with an air of assurance.</p>

<p>"Why do they go about in motors then," I wondered,
"if they don't take interest in things they pass?"</p>

<p>"You must understand as well as I do why this sort of
person goes about in motors," said he. "They go
because other people go&mdash;because it's the thing. The
'other people' whom they slavishly imitate may really like
the exhilaration, the ozone, the sight-seeing, or all three;
but to this type the only part that matters is letting it be
seen that they've got a handsome car, and being able
to say 'We've just come from the Riviera in our
sixty-horse-power motor-car.' They'd always mention
the power."</p>

<p>"Lady Turnour did, even to me," I remembered.
"But is Sir Samuel like that?"</p>

<p>"No, to do him justice, he isn't, poor man. But his
wife is his Juggernaut. I believe he enjoys lying under
her wheels, or thinks he does&mdash;which is the same thing."</p>

<p>"Have you been with them long?" I dared to inquire.</p>

<p>"Only a few days. I brought the car down for them
from Paris, though not this way&mdash;a shorter one. We're
new brooms, the car and I."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>"All their brooms seem to be new," I reflected. "I
wonder what the stepson is like?"</p>

<p>"Luckily it doesn't matter much to me," said the
chauffeur indifferently.</p>

<p>"Nor to me. But his name's Herbert."</p>

<p>"His surname?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. There's a Herbert lurking somewhere.
It always suggests to me oily hair parted in the middle and
smeared down on each side of a low, narrow forehead.
Could you know a 'Bertie'?"</p>

<p>"I did once, and never want to again. He was a swine
and a snob. Hope you never came across the combination?"</p>

<p>I forgot to answer, because, having left the mountain
world behind, a formidable line of nobly planned arches
began striding along beside us, through the sun-bright
fields, and I was sure it must be the giant Roman aqueduct
of Fr&eacute;jus.</p>

<p>Instead of discussing such little things as the Turnours
and their Bertie, we began to talk of Phoenicians, Ligurians,
and of Romans; of Pliny, who had a beloved friend
at Fr&eacute;jus; and all the while to breathe in the perfume
of a land over which a vast tidal wave of balsamic pines
had swept.</p>

<p>Fr&eacute;jus we were not to see now: that was for the dim
future, after lunch; but we turned to the left off the main
road, and ran on until we saw, bathed in pines, deliciously
deluged and drowned in pines, the white glimmer of
classic-looking villas. These meant Valescure, said the
chauffeur; and the Grand Hotel&mdash;not classic looking, but
pretty in its terraced garden&mdash;meant luncheon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>The car drew up before the door, according to order,
or rather, according to hypnotic suggestion; for it seems
that it is the chauffeur who alone knows anything of the
way, and who, while appearing to be non-committal, is
virtually planning the tour. "Valescure might be a good
stopping-place for lunch," he had murmured, an eye on
the road map over which his head bent with Sir Samuel's.
"Very beautiful&mdash;rather exclusive. You may remember
Mr. Chamberlain stopped there."</p>

<p>The exclusiveness and the Chamberlain-ness decided
Lady Turnour, behind Sir Samuel's shoulder (so the
chauffeur told me); consequently, here we were&mdash;and
not at St. Raphael, which would have seemed the more
obvious place to stop.</p>

<p>I say "we," but Lady Turnour would have been surprised
to hear that her maid dared count herself and a
chauffeur in the programme. Creatures like us must be
fed, just as you pour petrol into the tanks of a motor,
or stoke a furnace with coals, because otherwise our
mechanism wouldn't go, and that would be awkward
when we were wanted.</p>

<p>The chauffeur opened the door of the car as if he had
been born to open motor-car doors, and Lady Turnour
allowed herself to be helped out by her husband. Her
jewel-bag clutched in her hand (she doesn't know me
well enough yet to trust me with it, and hasn't had
bagsful of jewels for long), she passed her two servants
without expending a look on them. Sir Samuel followed,
telling his chauffeur to have the automobile ready at the
door again in an hour and a quarter; and we two Worms
were left to our own resources.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>"I shan't garage her," said my fellow Worm of the
car. "I'll just drive her out of the way, where I can look
over her a bit when I've snatched something to eat.
I'll take the fur rugs inside&mdash;you're not to bother,
they're big enough to swamp you entirely. And then you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, then I&mdash;" I repeated desolately. "What is
to become of me?"</p>

<p>"Why, you're to have your lunch, of course," he
replied. "I thought you said you were hungry."</p>

<p>"So I am, starving. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to have a proper lunch?"</p>

<p>"A sandwich and a piece of cheese will do for me,
because there are one or two little things to tinker up on
the car, and an hour and a quarter isn't long. I think
I shall bring my grub out of doors, and&mdash;But is
anything the matter?"</p>

<p>"I can't go in and have lunch alone. I simply can't,"
I confessed to the young man whose society I had intended
to avoid like a pestilence. "You see, I&mdash;I never&mdash;this
is the first time."</p>

<p>A look of comprehension flashed over his face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," he said. "Of course, the moment I
heard your voice I realized that this wasn't your sort of
work, but I didn't know you were quite so new to it as
all that. You've never taken a meal in the couriers'
room of an hotel?"</p>

<p>"No," I confessed. "At the Majestic Palace Lady
Kil&mdash;that is, I decided to have everything brought up to
my room, there."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>"By Jove, we are a strange pair! This is my first job,
too, and so far I've been able to feed where I chose;
but that's too good to last on tour. One must accommodate
oneself to circumstances, and a man easily can.
But you&mdash;I know how you feel. However, it's the
first step that costs. Do you mind much?"</p>

<p>"It's the stepping in alone that costs the most," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm only too delighted if I can be of the least
use. Let the car rip! I'll see to her afterward. Now
I'm going to take care of you. You need it more than
she does."</p>

<p>What would Lady Kilmarny have said if she had
heard my deliberate encouragement of the chauffeur,
and his reckless response? What would she have thought
if she could have seen us walking into the couriers' dining-room,
side by side, as if we had been friends for as many
years as we'd really been acquaintances for minutes,
leaving the car he was paid to cherish in his bosom
sulking alone!</p>

<p>That sweet lady's face, surprised and reproachful, rose
before my eyes, but I had no regrets. And instead of
trembling with apprehension when I saw that the couriers'
room was empty, I rejoiced in the prospect of lunching
alone with the redoubtable chauffeur.</p>

<p>It was too early for the regular feeding hour of the
<i>pensionnaires</i>, maids, and valets, and we sat down opposite
each other at the end of a long table. A bored young
waiter, with little to hope for in the way of <i>pourboires</i>,
ambled off in quest of our food. I began to unfasten
my head covering, and after a search for various fugitive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>pins I emerged from obscurity, like the moon from
behind a cloud.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief, I smiled at my companion; and
it was only his expression of surprise which reminded me
that he had been seeing me "as through a glass darkly."</p>

<p>I suppose, unless you are a sort of Sherlock Holmes of
physiognomy, you can't map out a woman's face by a
mere glimpse of eyes through a triangular bit of talc,
already somewhat damaged by exposure to sun and wind.</p>

<p>It mayn't be good manners to look a gift motor-veil
in the talc, but I must admit that, glad as I was of its
protection, mine was somewhat the worse for certain
bubbles, cracks, and speckles; so whether or no Mr. Bane
or Dane may combine the science of chauffeuring with
that of physiognomy, it's certain that he had the air of
being taken aback.</p>

<p>Of course, I know that I'm not exactly plain, and
that the contrast between my eyes and hair is a little
out of the common; so, as soon as I remembered that
he hadn't seen me before, I guessed more or less what
his almost startled look meant. Still, I suppose most
girls&mdash;anyway, half-French, half-American girls&mdash;would
have done exactly what I proceeded to do.</p>

<p>I looked as innocent as a fluffy chicken when it first
sidles out of its eggshell into the wide, wide world; and
said: "Oh, I do hope I haven't a smudge on the end of
my nose?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the chauffeur, instantly becoming
expressionless. "Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Only I was afraid, from your face, that there was
something wrong."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>"So far as I can see, there's nothing wrong," said he,
calmly, and broke a piece of bread. "Very good butter,
this, that they give to <i>nous autres</i>," he went on, in the
same tone of voice, and my respect for him increased.</p>

<p>(Men are really rather nice creatures, take them all
in all!)</p>

<p>As he had sacrificed his duty to the car for me, I sacrificed
my duty to my digestion for him, and bolted my
luncheon. Then, when released from guard duty, he
returned to his true allegiance, and I ventured to walk on
the terrace to admire the view.</p>

<p>Far away it stretched, over garden, and pineland,
and flowery meadow-spaces, to the blue, silver-sewn sea,
which to my fancy looked Homeric. Nothing modern
caught the eye to break the romance of the illusion. All
was as it might have been twenty or thirty centuries ago,
when on the Mediterranean sailed "Phoenicians, mariners
renowned, greedy merchantmen with countless gauds
in a black ship."</p>

<p>I had just begun to play that I was a young woman of
Tyre, taken on an adventurous excursion by an indulgent
father, when presto! Lady Turnour's voice brought me
back to the present with a jump. There's nothing
Homeric about her!</p>

<p>She and Sir Samuel had finished their luncheon, and
so had several other people. There was an exodus of
well-dressed, nice-looking women from dining-room to
terrace, and conscious that I ought to have been herding
among their maids, I fled with haste and humility. What
right had I, in this sweet place divinely fit to be a rest-cure
for goddesses tired of the social diversions of Olympus?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>I scuttled off to the car, and stood ready to serve my
mistress when it should please her to be tucked under
her rugs.</p>

<p>Despite delays, the chauffeur had finished whatever
had to be done, and soon we were spinning away from
Valescure, far away, into a world of flowers.</p>

<p>Black cypresses soared skyward, so clean cut, so
definite, that I seemed to hear them, crystal-shrill, like
the sharp notes in music, as they leaped darkly out
from a silver monotone of olives and a delicate ripple
of pearly plum or pear blossom. Mimosas poured floods
of gold over the spring landscape, blazing violently
against the cloudless blue. Bloom of peach and apple
tree garlanded our road on either side; the way was
jewelled with roses; and acres of hyacinths stretched
into the distance, their perfume softening the keenness
of the breeze.</p>

<p>"Are they going to let you pass Fr&eacute;jus without pausing
for a single look?" I asked mournfully. But at that
instant there came a peal of the electric bell which is one
of the luxurious fittings of the car. It meant "stop!"
and we stopped.</p>

<p>"Aren't there some ruins here&mdash;something middle-aged?"
asked Sir Samuel, meaning medi&aelig;val.</p>

<p>"Roman ruins, sir," replied his chauffeur, without
changing countenance.</p>

<p>"Are they the sort of things you ought to say you've seen?"</p>

<p>"I think most people do stop and see them, sir."</p>

<p>"What is your wish, my dear?" Sir Samuel gallantly
deferred to his bride. "I know you don't like out-of-door
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>sightseeing when it's windy, and blows your hair
about, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We might try, and if I don't like it, we can go on,"
replied Lady Turnour, patronizing the remains of Roman
greatness, since it appeared to be the "thing" for the
nobility and gentry to do.</p>

<p>The chauffeur obediently turned the big blue Aigle,
and let her sail into the very centre of the vast arena where
C&aelig;sar saw gladiators fight and die.</p>

<p>It was very noble, very inspiring, and from some shady
corner promptly emerged a quaintly picturesque old
guardian, ready to pour forth floods of historic information.
He introduced himself as a soldier who had seen fighting
in Mexico under Maximilian, therefore the better able
to appreciate and fulfil his present task. But her ladyship
listened for awhile with lack-lustre eyes, and finally,
when dates were flying about her ears like hail, calmly
interrupted to say that she was "glad she hadn't lived
in the days when you had to go to the theatre out of
doors."</p>

<p>"I can't understand more than one word in twelve
that the old thing says, anyhow," she went on. "Elise
must give me French lessons every day while she does
my hair. I hope she has the right accent."</p>

<p>"He's saying that this amphitheatre was once almost
as large as the one at N&icirc;mes, but that it would only hold
about ten thousand spectators," explained the chauffeur,
who was engaged partly for his French and knowledge
of France.</p>

<p>"It's nonsense bothering to know that now, when the
place is tumbling to pieces," sneered her ladyship.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>"I beg your pardon, my lady; I only thought that, as
a rule, the best people do feel bound to know these things.
But of course&mdash;" He paused deferentially, without
a twinkle in his eye, though I was pressing my lips tightly
together, and trying not to shake spasmodically.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, go on. What else does the old boy say,
then?" groaned Lady Turnour, <i>martyris&eacute;e</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Bane or Dane didn't dare to glance at me. With
perfect gravity he translated the guide's best bits, enlarging
upon them here and there in a way which showed that
he had independent knowledge of his own. And it was a
feather in his cap that his eloquence eventually interested
Lady Turnour. She made him tell her again how Fr&eacute;jus
was Claustra Gall&aelig; to C&aelig;sar, and how it was the
"Caput" for this part of the wonderful Via Aurelia, which
started at Rome, never ending until it came to Arles.</p>

<p>"Why, we've been to Rome, and we're going to Arles,"
she exclaimed. "We can tell people we've been over
the whole of the Via Aurelia, can't we? We needn't
mention that the automobile didn't arrive till after we
got to Cannes. And anyway, you say there were once
theatres there, and at Antibes, like the one at Fr&eacute;jus, so
we've been making a kind of Roman pilgrimage all
along, if we'd only known it."</p>

<p>"It is considered quite the thing to do, in Roman
amphitheatres, to make a tour of the prisoners' cells and
gladiators' dressing-rooms, the guide says," insinuated
the chauffeur. And then, when the bride and bridegroom,
reluctant but conscientious, were swimming round the
vast bowl of masonry, like tea-leaves floating in a great
cup, he turned to me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>"Why don't you thank me?" he inquired. "I was
doing it for you. I knew you hated to miss all this, and
I saw she meant to go on, so I intervened, in the only
way I could think of, to touch her."</p>

<p>"If you're always as clever as that, I don't see why
this shouldn't be <i>our</i> trip," I said. "That will be a
consolation."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll often need more consolation than
that," he answered. "Lady Turnour is&mdash;as the Americans say&mdash;a
pretty 'stiff proposition.'"</p>

<p>"Still, if you can hypnotize her into going to all the
places, and stopping to look at all the nicest things, this
will at least be a cheap automobile tour for us both."</p>

<p>I laughed, but he didn't; and I was sorry, for I thought
I deserved a smile. And he has a nice one, with even
white teeth in it, and a wistful sort of look in his eyes
at the same time: a really interesting smile.</p>

<p>I wondered what he was thinking about that made
him look so grave; but I conceitedly felt that it was
something concerning me&mdash;or the situation of us both.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>The tidal wave of pines followed us as, having
had one glance at the Porte Dor&eacute;e, we left
Fr&eacute;jus, old and new, behind. It followed us
out of gay little St. Raphael, lying in its alluvial plain
of flowers, and on along the coast past which the ships
of Augustus C&aelig;sar used to sail.</p>

<p>Not in my most starry dreams could I have fancied a
road as beautiful as that which opened to us soon, winding
above the dancing water.</p>

<p>Graceful dryad pines knelt by the wayside, stretching
out their arms to the sea, where charming little bays
shone behind enlacing branches, blue as the eyes of a
wood-nymph gleaming shyly through the brown tangle of
her hair. Pine balsam mingled with the bitter-sweet
perfume of almond blossom, and caught a pungent tang
of salt from the wind.</p>

<p>What romance&mdash;what beauty! It made me in love
with life, just to pass this way, and know that so much
hidden loveliness existed. I glanced furtively over my
shoulder at the couple whose honeymoon it is&mdash;our
master and mistress. Lady Turnour sat nodding in the
conservatory atmosphere of her glass cage, and Sir
Samuel was earnestly choosing a cigar.</p>

<p>Suddenly it struck me that Providence must have a
vast sense of humour, and that the little inhabitants of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>this earth, high and low, must afford It a great deal of
benevolent amusement.</p>

<p>All too soon we swept out of the forest, straight into a
little town, St. Maxime, with a picturesque port of its
own, where red-sailed fishing boats lolled as idly as the
dark-eyed young men in caf&eacute;s near the shore. A few
tourists walking out from the hotel on the hill gazed rather
curiously at us in our fine blue car; and we gazed away
from them, across a sapphire gulf, to the distant houses
of St. Tropez, banked high against a promontory of
emerald.</p>

<p>I should have liked to run on to St. Tropez, for I knew
his pretty legend; how he was one of the guards of St.
Paul in prison, and was converted by the eloquence of
his captive; but the chauffeur said that, after La Foux
(famed home of miniature horses) the coast road would
lose its surface of velvet. It would be laced in and out
with crossings of a local railway line, and there would be
so many bumps that Lady Turnour was certain to wake
up very cross.</p>

<p>"For your sake I don't want to make her cross,"
said he, and turned inland; but the way was no less
beautiful. The pines were tired of running after us, but
great cork trees marched beside the road, like an army of
crusaders in disarray, half in, half out, of armour. Above,
rose the Mountains of the Moors, whose very name
seemed to ring with the distant echo of a Saracen war
song; and here and there, on a bare, wild hillside, towered
all that was left of some ancient castle, fallen into ruin.
Cogolin was fine, and Grimaud was even finer.</p>

<p>Up a steep ascent, through shadowy forests we had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>passed, now and then coming suddenly upon a little
red-roofed village nestling among the trees as a strawberry
among its leaves, when abruptly we flashed out
where spaces of sky and silver sea opened. Between
hills that seemed to sweep a curtsey to us, we flew down
an apple-paring road toward Hy&egrave;res.</p>

<p>The Turnours had lunched, if not wisely, probably
too well, at Valescure about one o'clock, and it wasn't
yet four; but the air at the beautiful Costebelle hotels
is said to be perpetually glittering with Royalties and
other bright beings of the great world, so her ladyship
wouldn't have been persuaded to miss the place.</p>

<p>Not that anyone tried to persuade her, for the two
powers behind the throne (and in front of the car) wanted
to go&mdash;not to see the Royalties, but the beauties of
Costebelle itself.</p>

<p>We slipped gently through the town of Hy&egrave;res, whose
avenues of giant palms looked like great sea anemones
turned into trees, and then spurted up a hill into a vast
and fragrant grove that smelled of a thousand flowers.
In the grove stood three hotels, with wide views over
jade-green lagoons to an indigo sea; and at the most
charming of the trio we stopped.</p>

<p>Nothing was said about tea for the two servants, but
while the "quality" had theirs on an exquisite terrace,
the chauffeur brought a steaming cup to me, as I sat
in the car.</p>

<p>"This was given me for my <i>beaux yeux</i>," he said,
"but I don't want any tea, so please take it, and don't
let it be wasted."</p>

<p>I was convinced that he had paid for that cup of tea
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>with coin harder if not brighter than the <i>beaux yeux</i>
in question; but it would have hurt his feelings if I had
refused, therefore I drank the tea and thanked the giver.</p>

<p>"You are being very kind to me," I said, "Mr. Bane
or Dane; so do you mind telling me which it is?"</p>

<p>"Dane," he replied shortly. "Not that it matters.
A chauffeur by any other name would smell as much of
oil and petrol. It's actually my real name, too. Are
you surprised? I was either too proud or too stubborn
to change it&mdash;I'm not sure which&mdash;when I took up
'shuvving' for a livelihood."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not surprised," I said. "You don't look
like the sort of man who would change his name as if it
were a coat. I've kept mine, too, to 'maid' with. You
'shuv,' I 'maid.' It sounds like an exercise in a strange
language."</p>

<p>"That's precisely what it is," he answered. "A
difficult language to learn at first, but I'm getting the
'hang' of it. I hope you won't need to pursue the study
very thoroughly."</p>

<p>"And you think you will?"</p>

<p>"I think so," he said, his face hardening a little, and
looking dogged. "I don't see any way out of it for the present."</p>

<p>I was silent for almost a whole minute&mdash;which can
seem a long time to a woman&mdash;half hoping that he meant
to tell me something about himself; how it was that he'd
decided to be a professional chauffeur, and so on. I was
sure there must be a story, an interesting story&mdash;perhaps
a romantic one&mdash;and if he confided in me, I would
in him. Why not, when&mdash;on my part, at least&mdash;there's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>nothing to conceal, and we're bound to be companions
of the Road for weal or woe? But if he felt any temptation
to be expansive he resisted it, like a true Englishman;
and to break a silence which grew almost embarrassing
I was driven to ask him, quite brazenly, if he had no
curiosity to know my name.</p>

<p>"Not exactly curiosity," said he, smiling his pleasant
smile again. "I'm never curious about people I&mdash;like,
or feel that I'm going to like. It isn't my nature."</p>

<p>"It's just the opposite with me."</p>

<p>"We're of opposite sexes."</p>

<p>"You believe that explains it? I don't know.
Man may be a fellow creature, I suppose&mdash;though they
didn't teach me that at the Convent. But tell me this:
even if you have no curiosity, because you hope you can
manage to endure me, <i>do</i> you think I look like an
'Elise'?"</p>

<p>"Somehow, you don't. Names have different colours
for me. Elise is bright pink. You ought to be silver, or
pale blue."</p>

<p>"Elise is my professional name; Lady Turnour is my
sponsor. My real name's Lys&mdash;Lys d'Angely."</p>

<p>"Good! Lys <i>is</i> silver."</p>

<p>"I wish I could coin it. Let me see if I can guess
what you ought to be? You look like&mdash;like&mdash;well,
Jack would suit you. But that's too good to be true. I
shall never meet a 'Jack' except in books and ballads."</p>

<p>"My name is John Claud. But when I was a boy, I
always fought any chap who called me 'Claud,' and tried
to give him a black eye or a bloody nose. You may call
me Jack, if you like."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>"Certainly not. I shall call you Mr. Dane."</p>

<p>"Shuvvers are never mistered."</p>

<p>"Not even by the females of their kind? I always
supposed that manners were very toploftical in the servants'
hall."</p>

<p>"We may both soon know."</p>

<p>"Elise, take that cup at once where you got it from,
and come back to your place. We are ready to start."</p>

<p>This from Lady Turnour. (Really, if she takes to
interfering every time we others have got to the middle
of an interesting conversation, I don't know what I shall
do to her! Perhaps I'll put her transformation on side-wise.
Or would that be blackmail?)</p>

<p>Silently the chauffeur took the cup from my frightened
fingers, and marched off with it into the hotel, without a
"by your leave" or "with your leave."</p>

<p>"My word, your chauffeur might have better manners!"
grumbled Lady Turnour to Sir Samuel, as she climbed
into the car; but there was no scolding when the rude
young man came briskly back, looking supremely unconscious
of having given offence.</p>

<p>"Now we must make good time to Marseilles, if we're
to get there for dinner," he said, when he had started the
car, and taken his place. "We shall stop there to-night,
or rather, just outside the town, in one of the nicest
hotels on earth, as you will see."</p>

<p>"Whose choice?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Mine," he laughed, "but I don't think Sir Samuel knows that!"</p>

<p>Down to Hy&egrave;res we floated again, on the wings of the
Aigle, I looking longingly across the valley where the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>old town climbed a citadeled hill, and lay down at the foot
of a sturdy though crumbling castle. If this were <i>really</i>
my own tour, as I am trying to play it is, I would have
commanded a long stop at Costebelle, to make explorations
of the region round about. I can imagine no greater
joy than to be able to stay at beautiful places as long as
one wished, and to keep on doing beautiful things till
one tired of doing them.</p>

<p>But life is a good deal like a big busybody of a policeman,
continually telling us to get up and move on!</p>

<p>Our world was a flower world again, ringed in like a
secret fairyland, with distant mountains of extraordinarily
graceful shapes&mdash;charming lady-mountains; and as
far as we could see the road was cut through a carpet
of pink, white, and golden blossoms destined by and by
for the markets of Paris, London, Berlin, and Vienna.</p>

<p>Before I thought it could be so near, we dashed into
Toulon, a very different Toulon from the Toulon of the
railway station, where I remembered stopping a few
mornings (which seemed like a few years) ago. Now,
it looked a noble and impressive place, as well as a
tremendously busy town; but my eye climbed to the
towery heights above, wondering on which one Napoleon&mdash;a
smart young officer of artillery&mdash;placed the
batteries that shelled the British out of the harbour,
and gained for him the first small laurel leaf of his
imperial crown.</p>

<p>I thought, too, of all the French novels I'd read,
whose sailor heroes were stationed at Toulon, and there
met romantic or sensational adventures. They were
always handsome and dashing, those heroes, and as we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>threaded intricate fortifications, I found myself looking
out for at least one or two of them.</p>

<p>Yes, they were there, plenty of heroes, almost all handsome,
with splendid dark eyes that searched flatteringly
to penetrate the mystery of my talc triangle. They
didn't know, poor dears, that there was nothing better
than a lady's-maid behind it. What a waste of gorgeous
glances!</p>

<p>I laughed to myself at the fancy, and the chauffeur
sitting beside me wanted to know why; but I wouldn't
tell him. One really can't say everything to a man one
has known only for a day. And yet, the curious part is,
I feel as if we had been the best of friends for a long time.
I never felt like that toward any man before, but I suppose
it is because of the queer resemblance in our fates.</p>

<p>Beyond Toulon we had to slow down for a long procession
of gypsy caravans on their way to town; quaint,
moving houses, with strings of huge pearls that were
gleaming onions, festooned across their blue or green
doors and windows; and out from those doors and
windows wonderful eyes gazed at us&mdash;eyes full of
secrets of the East, strange eyes, more fascinating in their
passing glance than those of the gay young heroes at Toulon.</p>

<p>So we flew on to the village of Ollioules, and into the
dim mountain gorge of the same musical name. The
car plunged boldly through the veil of deep blue shadow
which hung, ghostlike, over the serpentine curves of the
white road; and out of its twilight-mystery rose always
the faint singing of a little river that ran beside us, under
the steep gray wall of towering rock.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>At the top of the gorge a surprise of beauty waited
for us as our way led along a sinuous road cut into
the swelling mountain-side. Far off lay the sea, with
an army of tremendous purple rocks hurling themselves
headlong into the molten gold of the water, like a drove of
mammoths. All the world was gold and royal purple.
Hills and mountains stood up, darkly violet, out of a
golden plain, against a sky of gold; and it was such a
picture as only Heaven or Turner could have painted.</p>

<p>Nor was there any break in the varied splendor of
the scene and of the sun's setting until we came to the
dull-looking town of Aubagne. After that, the Southern
darkness swooped in haste, and while we wound tediously
through the immense, never-ending traffic of Marseilles,
it "made night." All the length and breadth of the
Cannebi&egrave;re burst into brilliance of electric light, as if
in our honor. The great street looked as gay as a
Paris boulevard; and as we turned into it, we turned into
an adventure.</p>

<p>To begin with, nothing seemed less likely than an
adventure. We drew up calmly before the door of a
hotel whence a telephonic demand for rooms must be
sent to La Reserve, under the same management. It was
the chauffeur who had to go in and telephone, for the
bridegroom is even more helpless in French than the bride;
and before Mr. Dane could stop the car, Sir Samuel
called out: "Keep the motor going, to save time. You
needn't be a minute in there. Her ladyship is hungry,
and wants to get on."</p>

<p>The chauffeur raised his eyebrows, but obeyed in
silence, leaving the motor hard at work, the automobile
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>panting as impatiently to be off as if "she" suffered with
Lady Turnour.</p>

<p>No sooner was the tall, leather-clad figure out of sight
than a crowd of small boys and youths pressed boldly
round the handsome car. Her splendour was her undoing,
for a plain, every-day sort of automobile might have failed
to attract.</p>

<p>Laughing, jabbering <i>patois</i>, a dozen young imps forced
their audacious attentions on the unprotected azure
beauty. What was I, that I could defend her, left there
as helpless as she, while her great heart throbbed
under me?</p>

<p>It was easy to say "<i>Allez-vous en&mdash;va!</i>" and I said
it, not once, but again and again, each time more emphatically
than before. Nobody paid the slightest attention,
however, except, perhaps to find an extra spice of pleasure
in tormenting me. If I had been a yapping miniature
lap-dog, with teeth only <i>pour faire rire</i>, I could not have
been treated with greater disdain by the crowd. I glanced
hastily round to see if Sir Samuel had not taken alarm; but,
sitting beside his wife in the big crystal cage, he seemed
blissfully unconscious of danger to his splendid Aigle.
Instead, the couple looked rather pleased than otherwise
to be a centre of attraction.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I thought, "they're right, and these
young wretches can work no real harm to the car. They
ought to know better than I&mdash;"</p>

<p>But they didn't; for before the thought could spin
itself out in my mind, a gypsy-eyed little fiend of twelve
or thirteen made a spring at the driver's seat. With
a yelp of mischievous glee he proved his daring to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>comrades by snatching at the starting-lever. He was
quick as a flash of summer lightning, but if I hadn't been
quicker, the big car might have leaped into life, and run
amuck through the most crowded street in busy Marseilles.
I felt myself go cold and hot, horribly uncertain whether
my interference might work harm or good, but before I
quite knew what I did, I had sent the boy flying with a
sounding box on the ear.</p>

<p>He squealed as he sprawled backward, and I stood up,
ready for battle, my fingers tingling, my heart pounding.
The imp was up again, in half a breath, pushed forward
by his friends to take revenge, and I could hear Sir Samuel
or her ladyship wrestling vainly with the window behind
me. What would have happened next I can't tell, except
that I was in a mood to fight for our car till the death,
even if knives flashed out; and I think I was gasping
"Police! Police!" but at that instant Mr. Jack Dane
hurled himself like a catapult from the hotel. He dashed
the weedy youths out of his way like ninepins, jumped to
his seat, and the car and the car's occupants were safe.</p>

<p>"You are a trump, Miss d'Angely," said he, as we
boomed away from the hotel, scattering the crowd before
us as an eddy of wind scatters autumn leaves. "You
did just the right thing at just the right time. It was all
my fault. I oughtn't to have left the motor going."</p>

<p>"It was Sir Samuel's fault," I contradicted him.</p>

<p>"No. Whatever goes wrong with the car is always the
chauffeur's fault. Sir Samuel wanted me to do a foolish
thing, and I oughtn't to have done it. I had your life
to think of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And theirs."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>"Theirs, of course. But I would have thought of
yours first."</p>

<p>It made my heart feel as warm as a bird in a nest to
be complimented by the man at the helm for presence
of mind, and then to hear that already I'd gained a friend
to whom my life was of some value. Since my mother
died, there has been no one for whom I've come first.</p>

<p>I wanted badly to do something to show my gratitude,
but could think of nothing except that, by and by, when
we knew each other better, I might offer to sew on his
buttons or mend his socks.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>"I suppose we'll meet by-and-by at dinner?" I
said (I'm afraid rather wistfully) to the chauffeur
as he drove the car up a steep hill to the door of La
Reserve, on The Corniche.</p>

<p>"Well, no," he answered, "because you needn't fear
anything disagreeable here, and I'm going to stop at a
less expensive place. You see, I pay my own way,
and as I really have to live on my screw, it doesn't
run to grand hotels. This one <i>is</i> rather grand; but
you will be all right, because, although it's a famous
place for food, at this season few people stop overnight,
and I've found out through the telephone that the
Turnours are the only ones who have taken bedrooms.
That means you'll have your dinner and breakfast by
yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be nice!" I said, trying to speak as if
I delighted in the thought of solitude and reflection. "I
wish I were paying my own way, too; but I couldn't
do it on fifty francs a month, could I?"</p>

<p>"Fifty francs a month!" he echoed, astonished. "Is
that your compensation for being a slave to such a woman?
By Jove, it makes me hot all over, to think that a girl like
you should&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, this trip is thrown in as additional compensation,"
I reminded him. "And thanks to you and your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>kindness, I believe I'm going to find my place more than
tolerable."</p>

<p>The car stopped, and duty began. I couldn't even
turn and say good night to the chauffeur, as I walked
primly into the hotel, laden with my mistress's things.</p>

<p>She and Sir Samuel had the best rooms in the house,
a suite big enough and grand enough for a king and
queen, with a delightful <i>loggia</i> overlooking the high garden
and the sea. But of course Lady Turnour would
die rather than seem impressed by anything, and would
probably pick faults if she were invited to sleep at Buckingham
Palace or Windsor Castle&mdash;a contingency which
I think unlikely. She was snappish with hunger, and did
not trouble to restrain her temper before me. Poor Sir
Samuel! It is he who has snatched her from her lodging-house,
to lead her into luxury, because of his faithful
love of many years; and this is the way she rewards him!
If I'd been in his place, and had a javelin handy, I think
I might suddenly have become a widower.</p>

<p>She was better after dinner, however, so I knew she
must have been well fed: and in the morning, after a
gorgeous <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> on the loggia, she was in an amiable
mood to plan for the day's journey.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the chauffeur arrived, and was shown
up to the Turnours' vast Louis XVI. salon. He looked
as much like an icily regular, splendidly null, bronze statue
as a flesh-and-blood young man could possibly look, for
that, no doubt, is his conception of the part of a well-trained
"shuvver"; and he did not seem aware of my
existence as he stood, cap in hand, ready for orders.</p>

<p>As for me, I flatter myself that I was equally admirable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>in my own <i>m&eacute;tier</i>. I was assorting a motley collection
of guide-books, novels, maps, smelling-salts, and kodaks
when he came in, and was dying to look up, but I remained
as sweetly expressionless as a doll.</p>

<p>The bronze statue respectfully inquired how its master
would like to make a little <i>d&eacute;tour</i>, instead of going by
way of Aix-en-Provence to Avignon, as arranged. Within
an easy run was a spot loved by artists, and beginning to
be talked about&mdash;Martigues on the Etang de Berre, a
salt lake not far from Marseilles&mdash;said to be picturesque.
The Prince of Monaco was fond of motoring down
that way.</p>

<p>At the sound of a princely name her ladyship's mind
made itself up with a snap. So the change of programme
was decided upon, and curious as to the chauffeur's
motive, I questioned him when again we sat shoulder to
shoulder, the salt wind flying past our faces.</p>

<p>"Why the Etang de Berre?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I rather thought it would interest you. It's a
queer spot."</p>

<p>"Thank you. You think I like queer spots&mdash;and things?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and people. I'm sure you do. You'll like
the Etang and the country round, but <i>they</i> won't."</p>

<p>"That's a detail," said I, "since this tour runs itself
in the interests of the <i>femme de chambre</i> and the
chauffeur."</p>

<p>"We're the only ones who have any interests that
matter. It's all the same to them, really, where they go,
if I take the car over good roads and land them at expensive
hotels at night. But I'm not going to do that always.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
They've got to see the Gorge of the Tarn. They don't
know that yet, but they have."</p>

<p>"And won't they like seeing it?"</p>

<p>"Lady Turnour will hate it."</p>

<p>"Then we may as well give it up. Her will is mightier
than the sword."</p>

<p>"Once she's in, there'll be no turning back. She'll
have to push on to the end."</p>

<p>"She mayn't consent to go in."</p>

<p>"Queen Margherita of Italy is said to have the idea
of visiting the Tarn next summer. Think what it would
mean to Lady Turnour to get the start of a queen!"</p>

<p>"You are Machiavelian! When did you have this inspiration?"</p>

<p>"Well, I got thinking last night that, as they have
plenty of time&mdash;almost as much time as money&mdash;it
seemed a pity that I should whirl them along the road to
Paris at the rate planned originally. You see, though
there are plenty of interesting places on the way
mapped out&mdash;you've been to Tours, you say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What of that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the trip might as well be new for everybody
except myself; and as you like adventures&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You think it's the Turnours' duty to have them."</p>

<p>"Just so. If only to punish her ladyship for grinding
you down to fifty francs a month. What a reptile!"</p>

<p>"If she's a reptile, I'm a cat to plot against her."</p>

<p>"Do cats plot? Only against mice, I think. And
anyhow, <i>I'm</i> doing all the plotting. I've felt a different
man since yesterday. I've got something to live for."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>what?</i>" The question asked itself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>"For a comrade in misfortune. And to see her to her
journey's end. I suppose that end will be in Paris?"</p>

<p>"No-o," I said. "I rather think I shall go on all the
way to England with Lady Turnour&mdash;if I can stand it.
There's a person in England who will be kind to me."</p>

<p>"Oh!" remarked Mr. Dane, suddenly dry and taciturn
again. I didn't know what had displeased him&mdash;unless
he was sorry to have my company as far as England;
yet somehow I couldn't quite believe it was that.</p>

<p>All this talk we had while dodging furious trams and
enormous waggons piled with merchandise, in that maelstrom
of traffic near the Marseilles docks, which must
be passed before we could escape into the country. At
last, coasting down a dangerously winding hill with a
too suggestively named village at the bottom&mdash;L'Assassin&mdash;the
Aigle turned westward. The chauffeur let her
spread her wings at last, and we raced along a clear road,
the Etang already shimmering blue before us, like an
eye that watched and laughed.</p>

<p>Then we had to swing smoothly round a great circle,
to see in all its length and breadth that strange, hidden,
and fishy fairy-land of which Martigues is the door.
Once the Phoenicians found their way here, looking for
salt, which is exploited to this day; Marius camped
near enough to take his morning dip in the Etang, perhaps;
and Jeanne, queen of Naples, held Martigues for
herself. But now only fish, and fishermen, and a few
artists occupy themselves in that quaint little world which
one passes all regardlessly in the flying "<i>C&ocirc;te d'Azur</i>."</p>

<p>As we sailed round the road which rings the sleepy-looking
salt lake, Lady Turnour had a window opened
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>on purpose to ask what on earth the Prince of Monaco
found to admire in this flat country, where there were no
fine buildings? And her rebellion made me take alarm
for the success of our future plots. But the chauffeur
(anxious for the same reason, maybe, that she should be
content) explained things nicely.</p>

<p>Why, said he, for one thing the best fish eaten at
the best restaurants of Monte Carlo came out of the
Etang de Berre. The <i>bouillabaise</i> which her ladyship
had doubtless tasted at La Reserve last night, originally
owed much to the same source; and talking of <i>bouillabaise</i>,
Martigues was almost as famous for it as La
Reserve itself. One had but to lunch at the little hotel
Paul Chabas to prove that. And then, for less material
reasons, His Serene Highness might be influenced by the
fact that Corot had loved this ring of land which clasped
the Etang de Berre&mdash;Ziem, too, and other artists whose
opinion could not be despised.</p>

<p>These arguments silenced if they didn't convince Lady
Turnour, though she had probably never heard of Ziem,
or even Corot, and we two in front were able to admire
the charming scene in peace. Crossing bridges here
and there we saw, rising above sapphire lake and silver
belt of olives jewelled with rosy almond blossom, more
than one miniature Carcassonne, or ruined castle small
as if peeped at through a diminishing glass. There
was Port le Bouc, the Mediterranean harbour of the
Etang, or watergate to fairyland, as Martigues was the
door; Istre on its proud little height; Miramas and
Berre, important in their own eyes, and pretty in all others
when reflected in the glassy surface of blue water. There
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>were dark groups of cypresses, like mourning figures
talking together after a funeral&mdash;ancient trees who could
almost remember the Romans; and better than all else,
there was Pont Flavian, which these Romans had built.</p>

<p>Even Lady Turnour condescended to get out of the
car to do honour to the bridge with its two Corinthian
arches of perfect grace and beauty; but she had nothing
to say to the poor little, tired-looking lions sitting on top,
which I longed to climb up and pat.</p>

<p>She wanted to push on, and her one thought of Aix-en-Provence
was for lunch. Was Dane sure we should
find anything decent to eat there? Very well, then the
sooner we got it the better.</p>

<p>What a good thing there was someone on board the car
to appreciate Provence, someone to keep saying&mdash;"We're
in Provence&mdash;<i>Provence!</i>" repeating the word
just for the joy and music of it, and all it means
of romance and history!</p>

<p>If there had not been someone to say and feel that,
every turn of the tyres would have been an insult to
Provence, who had put on her loveliest dress to bid us
welcome. Among the olives and almonds, young trees
of vivid yellow spouted pyramids of thin, gold flame
against a sky of violet, and the indefinable fragrance
of spring was in the air. We met handsome, up-standing
peasants in red or blue <i>ber&eacute;ts</i>, singing melodiously in
<i>patois</i>&mdash;Proven&ccedil;al, perhaps&mdash;as they walked beside
their string of stout cart-horses. And the songs, and the
dark eyes of the singers, and the wonderful horned
harness which the noble beasts wore with dignity, all
seemed to answer us: "Yes, you are in Provence."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>We talked of old Provence, my Fellow Worm and I,
while our master and mistress wearied for their luncheon;
of the men and women who had passed along this road
which we travelled. What would Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;,
or Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, or George Sand have
said if a blue car like ours had suddenly flashed into their
vision? We agreed that, in any case, not one of them&mdash;or
any other person of true imagination&mdash;would call
abominable a wonderful piece of mechanism with the
power of flattening mountains into plains, triumphing
over space, annihilating distance; a machine combining
fiercest energy with the mildest docility. No, only old
fogies would close their hearts to a machine fit for the
gods, and pride themselves on being motophobes forever.
We felt ourselves, car and all, to be worthy of
this magic way, lined with blossoms that played like rosy
children among the strange rocks characteristic of
Provence&mdash;rocks which seemed to have boiled up all
hot out of the earth, and then to have vied with each
other in hardening into most fantastic shapes. Even
we felt ourselves worthy to meet a few troubadours, as
we drew near to Aix, where once they held their Courts
of Love; and we had talked ourselves into an almost
dangerously romantic mood by the time we arrived at
the hotel in the Cours Mirabeau.</p>

<p>There, in the wide central <i>Place</i>, sprayed a delicious
fountain splashed with gold by the sunlight that filtered
through an arbour of great trees; and there, too, was a
statue of good King Ren&eacute;. Perhaps, if I hadn't known
that Aix-en-Provence was the home of the troubadours,
and that its springs had been loved by the Romans before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>the days of Christianity, I might not have thought it more
charming than many another ancient sleepy town of
France; but it is impossible to disentangle one's imagination
and sentiment from one's eyesight; therefore, Aix
seemed an exquisite place to me.</p>

<p>Now that I knew how knight-errantry in some of its
branches was likely to affect Mr. Dane's pocket, I resolved
that nothing should tempt me to encourage him in the
pursuit. No matter how many flirtatious smiles were
shed upon me by enterprising waiters, no matter how
many conversations were begun by couriers who took
me for rather a superior sample of "young person," I
would bear all, all, without a complaint which might
seem like a hint for protection.</p>

<p>When Lady Turnour had forgotten me, in the dazzling
light that beat about the thought of luncheon, I almost
bustled into the hotel, and asked for the servants' dining-room.
I knew that there was little hope of eating alone,
for several important-looking motor-cars were drawn up
before the hotel; but I was hardly prepared for the gay
company I found assembled.</p>

<p>Three chauffeurs, a valet, and two maids were lunching,
and judging from appearances the meal was far enough
advanced to have cemented lifelong friendships. Wine
being as free as the air you breathe, in this country of
the grape, naturally the big glass <i>caraffes</i> behind the plates
were more than half empty, and the elder of the two
elderly maids had a shining pink knob on her nose.</p>

<p>I hadn't yet taken off my diving-bell (as I've named
my head covering), and every eye was upon me during
the intricate process of removal. Conversation, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>was in French, slackened in the interests of curiosity;
and when the new face was exposed to public gaze the
three gallant chauffeurs jumped up, as one man, each
with the kind intention of placing me in a chair next
himself. "<i>Voil&agrave; une petite t&ecirc;te trop jolie pour &ecirc;tre cach&eacute;e
comme &ccedil;a!</i>" exclaimed the best looking and boldest of
the trio.</p>

<p>The ladies of the party sniffed audibly, and raised
their somewhat moth-eaten eyebrows at each other in
virtuous disapproval of a young female who provoked
such remarks from strangers. The valet, who had the
air of being engaged to the maid with the nose, confined
himself to a non-committal grin, but the second and
third chauffeurs loyally supported their leader. "<i>Vous
avez raison</i>," they responded, laughing and showing
quantities of white teeth. Then they followed up their
compliment by begging that mademoiselle would sit
down, and allow her health to be drunk&mdash;with that of
the other ladies.</p>

<p>"Yes, sit down by me," said Number One, indicating
a chair. "This is the Queen's throne."</p>

<p>"By me," said Number Two. "I'll cut up your meat for you."</p>

<p>"By me," said Number Three. "I'll give you my
share of pudding."</p>

<p>By this time I was red to the ears, not knowing whether
it were wiser for a lady's-maid to run away, or to take the
rough chaff good-humouredly, and make the best of it.
I fluttered, undecided, never thinking of the old adage
concerning the woman who hesitates.</p>

<p>In an instant, it was forcibly recalled to my mind, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Number One chauffeur, smelling strongly of the good
red wine of Provence, came forward and offered me his arm.</p>

<p>This was too much.</p>

<p>"Please don't!" I stammered, in my confusion speaking
English.</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, Mademoiselle est Anglaise!</i>" the two others
exclaimed, "<i>Vive l'entente cordiale!</i> We are Frenchmen.
You are Italian. She belongs to our side."</p>

<p>"Let her choose," said the handsome Italian, pointing
his moustache and doing such execution upon me with
his splendid eyes, that if they'd been Maxim guns I should
have fallen riddled with bullets.</p>

<p>"I'll sit by nobody," I managed to answer, this time
in French. "Please take your seats. I will have a chair
at the other end of the table."</p>

<p>"You see, mademoiselle is too polite to choose between
us. She's afraid of a duel," laughed good-looking
Number One. "I tell you what we must do. We'll
draw lots for her. Three pellets of bread. The biggest wins."</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, monsieur," remarked Mr. Dane,
whom I hadn't seen as he opened the door, "mademoiselle
is of my party. She is waiting for me."</p>

<p>His voice was perfectly calm, even polite, but as I
whirled round and looked at him, fearing a scene, I saw
that his eyes were rather dangerous. He looked like a
dog who says, as plainly as a dog can speak, "I'm a
good fellow, and I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt.
But put that bone down, or I bite."</p>

<p>The Italian dropped the bone (I don't mind the simile)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
not because he was afraid, I think, but because Mr. John
Dane's chin was much squarer and firmer than his;
and because such sense of justice as he had told him
that the newcomer was within his rights.</p>

<p>"And I beg mademoiselle's pardon," he replied with
a bow and a flourish.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you've come&mdash;but I oughtn't to be,
and I didn't expect you," I said, when my chauffeur had
pulled out a chair for me at the end of the table farthest
from the other maids and chauffeurs.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he wanted to know, sitting down by my side.</p>

<p>"Because I suppose it's the best hotel in town,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're thinking of my pocket! I wish I hadn't
said what I did last night. Looking back, it sounds
caddish. But I generally do blurt out things stupidly.
If I didn't, I shouldn't be 'shuvving' now&mdash;only that's
another story. To tell the whole truth, it wasn't the state
of my pocketbook alone that influenced me last night.
I had two other reasons. One was a selfish one, and
the other, I hope, unselfish."</p>

<p>"I hope the selfish one wasn't fear of being bored?"</p>

<p>"If that's a question, it doesn't deserve an answer.
But because you've asked it, I'll tell you both reasons.
I'd stopped at La Reserve before, in&mdash;in rather different
circumstances, and I thought&mdash;not only might it make
talk about me, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand," I said. "Of course, Lady Turnour
isn't as careful a chaperon as she ought to be."</p>

<p>Then we both laughed, and the danger-signals were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>turned off in his eyes. When he isn't smiling, Mr. Dane
sometimes looks almost sullen, quite as if he could be
disagreeable if he liked; but that makes the change more
striking when he does smile.</p>

<p>"You needn't worry about that pocket of mine," he
went on, as we ate our luncheon. "It's as cheap
here as anywhere; and when I saw all those motors
before the door, I made up my mind that you'd
probably need a brother, so I came as soon as I could
leave the car."</p>

<p>"So you are my brother, are you?" I echoed.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you might adopt me, once for all,
in that relationship? Then, you see, the chaperoning
won't matter so much. Of course, it's early days to take
me on as a brother, but I think we'd better begin at once."</p>

<p>"Before I know whether you have any faults?" I
asked. And just for the minute, the French half of me
was a little piqued at his offer. That part of me pouted,
and said that it would be much more amusing to travel
in such odd circumstances beside a person one could
flirt with, than to make a pact of "brother and sister."
He might have given me the chance to say first that I'd
be a sister to him! But the American half slapped the
French half, and said: "What silly nonsense! Don't be
an idiot, if you can help it. The man's behaving beautifully.
And it will just do you good to have your vanity
stepped on, you conceited little minx!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've plenty of faults, I'll tell you to start with&mdash;plenty
you may have noticed already, and plenty more
you haven't had time to notice yet," said my new relative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
"I'm a sulky brute, for one thing, and I've got to be a
pessimist lately, for another&mdash;a horrid fault, that!&mdash;and
I have a vile temper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All those faults might be serviceable in a <i>brother</i>,"
I said. "Though in any one else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In a friend or a lover, they'd be unbearable, of course;
I know that," he broke in. "But who'd want me for a
friend? And as for a lover, why, I'm struck off the list
of eligibles, forever&mdash;if I was ever on it."</p>

<p>After that, we ate our luncheon as fast as we could
(a very bad habit, which I don't mean to keep up for
man or brother), and even though the others had begun
long before we did, we finished while they were still
cracking nuts and peeling apples, their spirits somewhat
subdued by the Englishman's presence.</p>

<p>"The great folk won't have got their money's worth
for nearly an hour yet," said Mr. Dane. "Don't you want
to go and have a look at the Cathedral? There are some
grand things to see there&mdash;the triptych called 'Le Buisson
Argent,' and some splendid old tapestry in the choir;
a whole wall and some marble columns from a Roman
temple of Apollo&mdash;oh, and you mustn't forget to look for
the painting of St. Mitre the Martyr trotting about with
his head in his hands. On the way to the Cathedral
notice the doorways you'll pass. Aix is celebrated for
its doorways."</p>

<p>(Evidently my brother passed through Aix, as well
as along the Corniche, under "different circumstances!")</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;I'm to go alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can't leave the car to take you. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>The French half of me was vexed again, but didn't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>dare let the sensible American half, which knew he was
right, see it, for fear of another scolding.</p>

<p>I thanked him in a way as businesslike as his own,
and said that I would take his advice; which I did.
Although I hate sightseeing by myself, I wouldn't let him
think I meant to be always trespassing on his good nature;
and afterward I was glad I hadn't yielded to my inclination
to be helpless, for the Cathedral and the doorways were
all he had promised, and more. It was a scramble to see
anything in the few minutes I had, though, and awful
to feel that Lady Turnour was hanging over my head like
a sword. The thought of how she would look and what
she would say if I kept the car waiting was a string tied
to my nerves, pulling them all at once, like a jumping-jack's
arms and legs, so that I positively ran back to the
hotel, more breathless than Cinderella when the hour of
midnight began to strike. But there was the magic glass
coach, not yet become a pumpkin; there was the chauffeur,
not turned into whatever animal a chauffeur does
turn into in fairy stories; and there were not Sir Samuel
and her ladyship, nor any sign of them.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness, I'm not late!" I panted. "I
was afraid I was. That dear verger wouldn't realize
that there could be anything of more importance in the
world than the statue of Ste. Martha and the Tarasque."</p>

<p>"Nothing is, really," said Mr. Dane, glancing up from
some dentist-looking work he was doing in the Aigle's
mouth under her lifted bonnet. "But you <i>are</i> a little
late&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" I gasped, pink with horror. "You don't mean
to say the Turnours have been out, and waiting?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>"I do, but don't be so despairing. I told them I
thought I'd better look the car over, and wasn't quite
ready. That's always true, you know. A motor's like
a pretty woman; never objects to being looked at. So
they said 'damn,' and strolled off to buy chocolates."</p>

<p>"It's getting beyond count how many times you've
saved me, and this is only our second day out," I exclaimed.
"Here they come now, as they always do, when we exchange a word."</p>

<p>I trembled guiltily, but there was no more than a vague
general disapproval in Lady Turnour's eyes, the kind of
expression which she thinks useful for keeping servants in
their place.</p>

<p>I got into mine, on the front seat; the car's bonnet
got into its, the chauffeur into his, and at just three o'clock
we turned our backs upon good King Ren&eacute;.</p>

<p>The morning had drunk up all the sunshine of the day,
leaving none for afternoon, which was troubled with a
hint of coming mistral. The landscape began to look
like a hastily sketched water-colour, with its hills and
terraces of vine; and above was a pale sky, blurred like
greasy silver. The wind roamed moaning among the
tops of the tall cypresses, set close together to protect the
meadows from one of "the three plagues of Provence."
And even as the mistral tweaked our noses with a chilly
thumb and finger, our eyes caught sight of the second and
more dreaded plague: the deceitfully gentle-seeming
Durance, which in its rage can come tearing down from
the Alps with the roar of a famished lion.</p>

<p>Far above the wide river, the Aigle glided across a
high-hung suspension bridge, the song of the water floating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>up to our ears mingling with the purr of the motor&mdash;two
giant forces, one set loose by nature, the other by
man, duetting harmoniously together, while the wind
wailed over our heads. But for the third and last plague
of Provence we would have had to search in vain, for the
land is no longer tormented by Parliament.</p>

<p>Always the road had stretched before us, up hill after
hill, as straight drawn between its scantily grass-covered
banks as the parting in an old man's hair; and always,
far ahead, wave following wave of hill and mountain had
seemed to roll toward us like the sea as we advanced to
meet them. After the vineyards had come wild rocks,
set with crumbling forts, and towers, and ch&acirc;teaux;
then the mild interest of fruit blossom spraying pink and
white among primly pollarded olives; then grape country
again, with squat, low-growing vines like gnomes kicking
up gnarled legs as they turned somersaults; then a break
into wonderful mountain country, with Orgon's ruins
towering skyward, dark as despair, a wild romance in stone.
But before we reached the great suspension bridge, the
Pont de Bonpas, the landscape appeared exhausted after
its sublime efforts, and inclined to quiet down for a rest.
It was only near Avignon that it sprung up refreshed,
ready for more strange surprises; and the grim grandeur
of the scenery as we approached the ancient town seemed
to prophesy the medi&aelig;val towers and ramparts of the
historic city.</p>

<p>Skirting the huge city wall, the blue car was the one
note of modernity; but hardly had we turned in at a great
gate worthy to open in welcome for Queen Jeanne of
Naples, or Bertrand du Guesclin, than we were in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>hum of twentieth-century life. I resented the change,
for one expects nothing, wants nothing, modern in Avignon;
but in a moment or two we had left the bright caf&eacute;s
and shops behind, to plunge back into the middle ages.
Anything, it seemed, might happen in the queer, shadowed
streets of tall old houses with mysterious doorways,
through which the Aigle cautiously threaded, like a
glittering crochet needle practicing a new stitch. Then,
in the quiet <i>place</i>, asleep and dreaming of stirring deeds
it once had seen, we stopped before a dignified building
more like some old ducal family mansion than a hotel.</p>

<p>But it was a hotel, and we were to stop the night in it,
leaving all sightseeing for the next morning. Lady
Turnour was tired. She had done too much already for
one day&mdash;with a reproachful glance at the chauffeur
whom she thus made responsible for her prostration.
Nothing would induce her to go out again that evening,
and she thought that she would dine in her own sitting-room.
She didn't like old places, or old hotels, but
she supposed she would have to make the best of this
one. She was a woman who <i>never</i> complained, unless
it really was her duty, and then she didn't hesitate.</p>

<p>This was her mood when getting out of the car, but
inside the quaint and charming house a look at the
visitors' register changed it in a flash. There was one
prince and one duke; there were several counts; and as
to barons, they were peppered about in rich profusion.
Each noble being was accompanied by his chauffeur, so
evidently it was the "thing" to stop in the Hotel de
l'Europe, and the <i>haut monde</i> considered Avignon worth
wasting time upon. Instantly her ladyship resolved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>to recover gracefully from her fatigue, and descend to the
public dining-room for dinner.</p>

<p>So fascinated was she by the list of great names, that
she lingered over the reading of them, as one lingers
over the last strawberries of the season; and I had to
stand at attention close behind her, with her rugs over
my arm, lest any one should miss seeing that she had a
maid.</p>

<p>"Dane says the best thing is to make Avignon a centre,
and stop here two or three nights, 'doing' the country
round, before going on to N&icirc;mes or Arles," she said to
Sir Samuel, who was clamouring for the best rooms in
the house. "I didn't feel I should like that plan, but
thinking it over, I'm not sure he isn't right."</p>

<p>I knew very well what her "thinking it over" meant!</p>

<p>They stood discussing the pros and cons, and as I didn't
yet know the numbers of our rooms, I was obliged to wait
till I was told. I was not bored, however, but was looking
about with interest, when I heard the teuf-teuf of a
motor-car outside. "There goes Mr. Jack Dane with
the Aigle," I thought; and yet there was a difference in
the sound. I'm too amateurish in such matters to understand
the exact reason for such differences, though chauffeurs
say they could tell one make of motor from another
by ear if they were blindfolded. Perhaps it wasn't our
car leaving, but another one coming to the hotel!</p>

<p>I had nothing better to do than to watch for new arrivals.
My eyes were lazily fixed on the door, and presently it
opened. A figure, all fur and a yard wide, came in.</p>

<p>It was the figure of Monsieur Charretier.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>For a minute everything swam before me, as it
used to at the Convent after some older girl had
twisted up the ropes of the big swing, with me in
it, and let me spin round. Also, I felt as if a jugful of
hot water had been dashed over my head. I seemed to
feel it trickling through my hair and into my ears.</p>

<p>If I could have moved, I believe I should have bolted
like a frightened rabbit, perfectly regardless of what Lady
Turnour might think, caring only to dart away without
being caught by the man I'd done such wild deeds to
escape. But I was as helpless as a person in a nightmare;
and, indeed, it was as unreal and dreadful to me as a
nightmare to see that fat, fur-coated figure walking
toward me, with the bearded face of Monsieur Charretier
showing between turned-up collar and motor-cap surmounted
by lifted goggles.</p>

<p>They say you have time to think of everything while
you are drowning. I believe that, now, because I had
time to think of everything while that furry gentleman
took a dozen steps. I thought of all the things he
and my cousins had ever done to disgust me with him
during his "courtship." I asked myself whether his
arrival here was a coincidence, or whether he'd been tracking
me all along, step by step, while I'd been chuckling
to myself over my lucky escape. I thought of what he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>would do when he recognized me, and what Lady Turnour
would say, and Sir Samuel. And although I couldn't
see exactly what good he could do in such a situation,
I wished vaguely that my brother the chauffeur were on
the spot. Then suddenly, with a wild rush of joy, I
remembered that I was facing the danger through my
little talc window.</p>

<p>Any properly trained heroine of melodrama would
have ejaculated "Saved!" but I haven't a tragedy nose,
and I gave only a stifled squeak, more like the swan-song
of a dying frog than anything more romantic.</p>

<p>Nobody heard it, luckily; and Monsieur Charretier,
who had just come into the twilight of the hall from the
brighter light out of doors, bustled past the retiring figure
of the lady's-maid without a glance. I had even to take
a step out of his way, not to be brushed by his fur shoulder,
so wide he was in his expensive motoring coat; and trembling
from the shock, I awkwardly collided with Lady
Turnour. She, in her turn, avoiding my onslaught as
if I'd been a beggar in rags, stepped on Monsieur Charretier's
toe.</p>

<p>He exclaimed in French, she apologized in English.</p>

<p>He bowed a great deal, assuring madame that she had
not inconvenienced him. She accused her maid, whose
stupidity was in fault; and because each one looked to
the other rich and prosperous they were extremely polite
to one another. Even then, though her ladyship snapped
at me, "What <i>has</i> come over you, Elise? You're as
clumsy as a cow!" he had no notice to waste upon the
<i>femme de chambre</i>. Yet I dared not so much as murmur,
"Pardon!" lest he should recognize my voice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>Fortunately my mistress and her husband were now
ready to go up to their rooms, and we left Monsieur
Charretier engaging quarters for himself and his chauffeur.
Evidently he was going to stop all night; but from
his indifference to me I judged joyfully that he had not
come to the hotel armed with information concerning my
movements. He might be searching for his lost love,
but he didn't know that she was at hand.</p>

<p>All my pleasure in the thought of sightseeing at Avignon
was gone, like a broken bubble. I shouldn't dare to
see any sights, lest I should be seen. But stopping indoors
wouldn't mean safety. Lady's-maids can't keep their
rooms without questions being asked; and if I pretended
to be ill, very likely Lady Turnour would discharge me
on the spot, and leave me behind as if I were a cast-off
glove. Yet if I flitted about the corridors between my
mistress's room and mine, I might run up against the
enemy at any minute.</p>

<p>I tried to mend the ravelled edges of my courage by
reminding myself that Monsieur Charretier couldn't
pick me up in his motor-car, and run off with me against
my will; but the argument wasn't much of a stimulant.
To be sure, he couldn't use violence, nor would he try;
but if he found me here he would "have it out" with me,
and he would tell things to Lady Turnour which would
induce her to send me about my business with short shrift.</p>

<p>He could say that I'd run away from my relatives, who
were also my guardians, and altogether he could make
out a case against me which would look a dark brown,
if not black. Then, when Lady Turnour and Sir Samuel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>had washed their hands of me, and I was left in a strange
hotel, practically without a sou&mdash;unless the Turnours
chose to be inconveniently generous, and packed me off
with a ticket to Paris&mdash;I should find it very difficult to
escape from my Corn Plaster admirer. This time there
would be no kind Lady Kilmarny to whom I could appeal.</p>

<p>Between two evils, one chooses that which makes less
fuss. It wasn't as intricate to risk facing Monsieur
Charretier as it was to eat soap and be seized with convulsions;
so I went about my business, waiting upon her
ladyship as if I had not been in the throes of a mental
earthquake. She was not particularly cross, because the
gentleman whose acquaintance I had thrust upon her
might turn out to be Somebody, in which case my clumsiness
would be a blessing in disguise; but if she had
boxed my ears I should hardly have felt it.</p>

<p>Bent upon dazzling the eyes of potentates in the dining-room,
and outshining possible princesses, the lady was
very particular about her dress. Although the big luggage
had gone on by train to some town of more importance
(in her eyes) than Avignon, she had made me keep
out a couple of gowns rather better suited for a first night
of opera in Paris than for dinner at the best of provincial
hotels. She chose the smarter of these toilettes, a black
<i>chiffon</i> velvet embroidered with golden tiger-lilies, and filled
in with black net from shoulder to throat. Then the blue
jewel-bag was opened, and a nodding diamond tiger-lily
to match the golden ones was carefully selected from a
blinding array of brilliants, to glitter in her masses of
copper hair. Round her neck went a rope of pearls that
fell to the waist whose slenderness I had just, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>mighty muscular effort, secured; but not until she had
dotted a few butterflies, bats, beetles and other scintillating
insects about her person was she satisfied with the effect.
At least, she was certain to create a sensation, as Sir
Samuel proudly remarked when he walked in to get his
necktie tied by me&mdash;a habit he has adopted.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I ought to trust Elise with my bag?"
Lady Turnour asked him, anxiously, at last. "So far,
since we've been on tour, I've carried it over my arm
everywhere, but it doesn't go very well with a costume
like this. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"Why, I think that Elise is a very good girl, and that
your jewels will be perfectly safe with her if you tell her to
take care of the bag, and not let it out of her sight,"
replied Sir Samuel, evidently embarrassed by such a
question within earshot of the said Elise.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'd better have dinner in my own room, so
as to guard it more carefully?" I suggested, brightening
with the inspiration.</p>

<p>"That's not necessary," answered her ladyship. "You
can perfectly well eat downstairs, with the bag over your
arm, as I have done for the last two days. I don't intend
to pay extra for you to have your meals served in your
room on any excuse whatever."</p>

<p>I couldn't very well offer to pay for myself. That
would have raised the suspicion that I had hidden reasons
of my own for dining in private, and I regretted that I
hadn't held my tongue. Lady Turnour ostentatiously
locked the receptacle of her jewels with its little gilded
key, which she placed in a gold chain-bag studded with
rubies as large as currants; and then, reminding me that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
I was responsible for valuables worth she didn't know
how many thousands, she swept away, leaving a trail of
white heliotrope behind.</p>

<p>In any case I would wait, I thought, until I could be
tolerably certain that all the guests of the hotel had gone
down to dinner. If I knew Monsieur Charretier, he
would be among the first to feed, but I couldn't afford to
run needless risks. I lingered over the task of putting my
mistress's belongings in order, almost with pleasure, and
then, once in my own room, I took as long as I could with
my own toilet. I was ready at last, and could think
of no further excuse for pottering, when suddenly it
occurred to me that I might do my hair in a demurer, less
becoming way, so that, if I should have the ill luck to
encounter a sortie of the enemy, I might still contrive to
pass without being recognized.</p>

<p>I pinned a clean towel round my neck, barber fashion,
and pulling the pins out of my hair, shook it down over
my shoulders. But before I could twist it up again, there
came a light tap, tap, at the door.</p>

<p>"There!" I thought. "Some one has been sent to
tell me the servants' dinner will be over if I don't hurry.
Perhaps it's too late already, and I'm <i>so</i> hungry!"</p>

<p>I bounced to the door, and threw it wide open, to find
Mr. John Dane standing in the passage, holding a small
tray crowded with dishes.</p>

<p>"Here you are," he said, in the most matter-of-fact
way, as if bringing meals to my door had been a fixed
habit with him, man and boy, for years. "Hope I
haven't spilt anything! There's such a crush in our
feeding place that I thought you'd be safer up here. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
I made friends with a dear old waiter chap, and said I
wanted something nice for my sister."</p>

<p>"You didn't!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I did. Do you mind much? I understood it was
agreed that was our relationship."</p>

<p>"No, I don't mind much," I returned. "Thank you
for everything." I shook back a cloud of hair, and
glanced up at the chauffeur. Our eyes met, and as I
took the tray my fingers touched his. His dark face grew
faintly red, and then a slight frown drew his eyebrows
together.</p>

<p>"Why do you suddenly look like that?" I asked.
"Have I done anything to make you cross?"</p>

<p>"Only with myself," he said.</p>

<p>"But why? Are you sorry you've been kind to me?
Oh, if you only knew, I need it to-night. Go on being kind."</p>

<p>"You're not the sort of girl a man can be kind to,"
he said, almost gruffly, it seemed to me.</p>

<p>"Am I ungrateful, then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are," he answered. "I only
know that if I looked at you long as you are now I
should make an ass of myself&mdash;and make you detest or
despise me. So good night&mdash;and good appetite."</p>

<p>He turned to go, but I called him back. "Please!" I
begged. "I'll only keep you one minute. I'm sure
you're joking, big brother, about being an ass, or poking
fun at me. But I don't care. I need some advice so
badly! I've no one but you to give it to me. I know you
won't desert me, because if you were like that you
wouldn't have come to stop at this hotel to watch over your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>new sister&mdash;which I'm sure you did, though that may
sound ever so conceited."</p>

<p>"Of course I won't desert you," he said. "I couldn't&mdash;now,
even if I would. But I'll go away till you've
had your dinner, and&mdash;and made yourself look less like
a siren and more like an ordinary human being&mdash;if
possible. Then I'll run up and knock, and you can
come out in the passage to be advised."</p>

<p>"A siren&mdash;with a towel round her neck!" I laughed.
"If I should sing to you, perhaps you might say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, for heaven's sake, or there would be an end
of&mdash;your brother," he broke in, laughing a little. "It
wouldn't need much more." And with that he was off.</p>

<p>He is very abrupt in his manner at times, certainly,
this strange chauffeur, and yet one's feelings aren't
exactly hurt. And one feels, somehow, as I think the
motor seems to feel, as if one could trust to his guidance
in the most dangerous places. I'm sure he would give his
life to save the car, and I believe he would take a good
deal of trouble to save me; indeed, he has already taken
a good deal of trouble, in several ways.</p>

<p>When he had gone I set down the tray, shut the door,
and went to see how I really did look with my hair hanging
round my shoulders. My ideas on the subject of
sirenhood are vague; but I must confess, if the creatures
are like me with my hair down, they must be quite nice,
harmless little persons. I admire my hair, there's so
much of it; and at the ends, a good long way below my
waist, there's such a thoroughly agreeable curl, like a
yellow sea-wave just about to break. Of course, that
sounds very vain; but why shouldn't one admire one's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>own things, if one has things worth admiring? It seems
rather ungrateful to Providence to cry them down; and
ingratitude was never a favourite vice with me.</p>

<p>One would have said that the chauffeur knew by
instinct what I liked best to eat, and he must have had a
very persuasive way with the waiter. There was cr&ecirc;me
d'orge, in a big cup; there were sweetbreads, and there
was lemon meringue. Nothing ever tasted better since
my "birthday feasts" as a child, when I was allowed to
order my own dinner.</p>

<p>My room being on the first floor, though separated by
a labyrinth of quaint passages from Lady Turnour's, there
was danger in a corridor conversation with Mr. Dane
at an hour when people might be coming upstairs after
dinner; but he was in such a hurry to escape from me
that I had no time to explain; and I really had not the
heart to make myself hideous, by way of disguise, as I'd
planned before his knock at the door. As an alternative
I put on a hat, pinning quite a thick veil over my face,
and when the expected tap came again, I was prepared
for it.</p>

<p>"Are you going out?" my brother asked, looking
surprised, when I flitted into the dim corridor, with Lady
Turnour's blue bag dutifully slipped on my arm.</p>

<p>"No," I answered. "I'm <i>hiding</i>. I know that sounds
mysterious, or melodramatic, or something silly, but
it's only disagreeable. And it's what I want to ask
your advice about." Then, shamefacedly when it came
to the point, I unfolded the tale of Monsieur Charretier.</p>

<p>"By Jove, and he's in this house!" exclaimed the
chauffeur, genuinely interested, and not a bit sulky.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
"You haven't an idea whether he's been actually tracking you?"</p>

<p>"If he has, he must have employed detectives, and
clever ones, too," I said, defending my own strategy.</p>

<p>"Is he the sort of man who would do such a thing&mdash;put
detectives on a girl who's run away from home to get
rid of his attentions?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I only know he has no idea of being
a gentleman. What can you expect of Corn Plasters?"</p>

<p>"Don't throw his corn plasters in his face. He might
be a good fellow in spite of them."</p>

<p>"Well, he isn't&mdash;or with them, either. He may
be acting with my cousin's husband, who values him
immensely, and wants him in the family."</p>

<p>"Is he very rich?"</p>

<p>"Disgustingly," said I, as I had said to Lady Kilmarny.</p>

<p>"Yet you bolted from a good home, where you had
every comfort, rather than be pestered to marry him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what do you call a 'good home,' and 'every comfort'?
I had enough to eat and drink, a sunny room,
decent clothes, and wasn't allowed to work except for
Cousin Catherine. But that isn't my idea of goodness
and comfort."</p>

<p>"Nor mine either."</p>

<p>"Yet you seem surprised at me."</p>

<p>"I was thinking that, little and fragile as you look&mdash;like
a delicate piece of Dresden china&mdash;you're a brave girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you!" I cried. "I do love to be called
'brave' better than anything, because I'm really such a
coward. You don't think I've done wrong?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>"No-o. So far as you've told me."</p>

<p>"What, don't you believe I've told you the truth?"
I flashed out.</p>

<p>"Of course. But do women ever tell the whole truth
to men&mdash;even to their brothers? What about that
kind friend of yours in England?"</p>

<p>"What kind friend?" I asked, confused for an instant.
Then I remembered, and&mdash;almost&mdash;chuckled. The
conversation I had had with him came back to me, and I
recalled a queer look on his face which had puzzled me
till I forgot it. Now I was on the point of blurting out:
"Oh, the kind friend is a Miss Paget, who said she'd
like to help me if I needed help," when a spirit of mischief
seized me. I determined to keep up the little mystery
I'd inadvertently made. "I know," I said gravely.
"<i>Quite</i> a different kind of friend."</p>

<p>"Some one you like better than Monsieur Charretier?"</p>

<p>"<i>Much</i> better."</p>

<p>"Rich, too?"</p>

<p>"Very rich, I believe, and of a noble family."</p>

<p>"Indeed! No doubt, then, you are wise, even from a
worldly point of view, in refusing the man your people
want you to marry, and taking&mdash;such extreme measures
not to let yourself be over persuaded," said Mr. Dane,
stiffly, in a changed tone, not at all friendly or nice, as
before. "I meant to advise you not to go on to England
with Lady Turnour, as the whole situation is so unsuitable;
but now, of course, I shall say no more."</p>

<p>"It was about something else I wanted advice," I
reminded him. "But I suppose I must have bored you.
You suddenly seem so cross."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>"I am not in the least cross," he returned, ferociously.
"Why should I be?&mdash;even if I had a right, which I haven't."</p>

<p>"Not the right of a brother?"</p>

<p>"Hang the rights of a brother!" exclaimed Mr. Dane.</p>

<p>"Then don't you want to be my brother any more?"</p>

<p>He walked away from me a few steps, down the corridor,
then turned abruptly and came back. "It isn't a question
of what I want," said he, "but of what I can have. Sometimes
I think that after all you're nothing but an outrageous
little flirt."</p>

<p>"Sometimes? Why, you've only known me two days.
As if you could judge!"</p>

<p>"Far be it from me to judge. But it seems as though
the two days were two years."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Well, I may be a flirt&mdash;the French side
of me, when the other side isn't looking. But I'm not
flirting with <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Why should you waste your time flirting with a
wretched chauffeur?"</p>

<p>"Yes, why? Especially as I've other things to think
of. But I don't <i>want</i> your advice about those things
now. I wouldn't have it even if you begged me to.
You've been too unkind."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, with all my heart," he said, his
voice like itself again. "I'm a brute, I know! It's that
beastly temper of mine, that is always getting me into
trouble&mdash;with myself and others. Do forgive me, and
let me help you. I want to very much."</p>

<p>"I just said I wouldn't if you begged."</p>

<p>"I don't beg. I insist. I'll inflict my advice on you,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>whether you like it or not. It's this: get the man out
of Avignon the first thing to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"That's easy to say!"</p>

<p>"And easy to do&mdash;I hope. What would be his first
act, do you think, if he got a wire from you, dated Genoa,
and worded something like this: 'Hear you are following
me. I send this to Avignon on chance, to tell you persecution
must cease or I will find means to protect myself.
Lys d'Angely.'"</p>

<p>"I think he'd hurry off to Genoa as fast as he could go&mdash;by
train, leaving his car, or sending it on by rail. But
how could I date a telegram from Genoa?"</p>

<p>"I know a man there who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Elise, I'm astonished at you!" exclaimed the shocked
voice of Lady Turnour. "Talking in corridors with
strange young men! and you've been out, too, without
my permission, and <i>with</i> my jewel-bag! How dare
you?"</p>

<p>"I haven't been out," I ventured to contradict.</p>

<p>"Then you were going out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I had no intention of going out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't answer me back like that! I won't stand it.
What are you doing in your hat, done up in a thick veil,
too, at this time of night, as if you were afraid of being
recognized?"</p>

<p>I had to admit to myself that appearances were dreadfully
against me. I didn't see how I could give any
satisfactory explanation, and while I was fishing wildly in
my brain without any bait, hoping to catch an inspiration,
the chauffeur spoke for me.</p>

<p>"If your ladyship will permit me to explain," he began,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>more respectfully than I'd heard him speak to anyone
yet, "it is my fault ma'mselle is dressed as she is."</p>

<p>"What on earth is he going to say?" I wondered wildly,
as he paused an instant for Lady Turnour's consent,
which perhaps an amazed silence gave. I believed that
he didn't know himself what to say.</p>

<p>"I wanted your ladyship's maid, when she had nothing
else to do, to put on her out-of-door things and let
me make a sketch of her for an illustrated newspaper
I sometimes draw for. Naturally she didn't care for
her face to go into the paper, so she insisted upon
a veil. My sketch is to be called, 'The Motor Maid,'
and I shall get half a guinea for it, I hope, of which it's
my intention to hand ma'mselle five shillings for obliging
me. I hope your ladyship doesn't object to my earning
something extra now and then, so long as it doesn't
interfere with work?"</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Lady Turnour, taken aback by
this extraordinary plea, as well she might have been, "I
don't like to tell a person out and out that I don't believe
a word he says, but I do go as far as this: I'll believe you
when I see you making the sketch. And as for earning
extra money, I should have thought Sir Samuel paid good
enough wages for you to be willing to smoke a pipe and
rest when your day's work was done, instead of gadding
about corridors gossiping with lady's-maids who've no
business to be outside their own room. But if you're so
greedy after money&mdash;and if you want me to take Elise's word&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll just begin the sketch in your ladyship's presence,
if I may be excused," said Mr. Dane, briskly. And to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>my real surprise, as well as relief, he whipped a small
canvas-covered sketch-book out of his pocket. It was
almost like sleight of hand, and if he'd continued the
exhibition with a few live rabbits and an anaconda or
two I couldn't have been much more amazed.</p>

<p>"I'd like to have a look at that thing," observed Lady
Turnour, suspiciously, as in a business-like manner he
proceeded to release a neatly sharpened pencil from an
elastic strap.</p>

<p>Without a word or a guilty twitch of an eyelid he handed
her the book, and we both stood watching while the fat,
heavily ringed and rosily manicured fingers turned over
the pages.</p>

<p>He could sketch, I soon saw, better than I can, though
I've (more or less) made my living at it. There were
types of French peasants done in a few strokes, here
and there a suggestion of a striking bit of mountain
scenery, a quaint cottage, or a ruined castle. Last of
all there was a very good representation of the Aigle,
loaded up with the Turnours' smart luggage, and
ready to start. My lips twitched a little, despite the
strain of the situation, as I noted the exaggerated size of
the crest on the door panel. It turned the whole thing
into a caricature; but luckily her ladyship missed the
point. She even allowed her face to relax into a faint
smile of pleasure.</p>

<p>"This isn't bad," she condescended to remark.</p>

<p>"I thought of asking your ladyship and Sir Samuel if
there would be any objection to my sending that to a
Society motoring paper, and labelling it 'Sir Samuel
and Lady Turnour's new sixty-horse-power Aigle on tour
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>in Provence.' Or, if you would prefer my not using your
name, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see no reason why you should <i>not</i> use it," her ladyship
cut in hastily, "and I'm sure Sir Samuel won't
mind. Make a little extra money in that way if you like,
while we're on the road, as you have this talent."</p>

<p>She gave him back the book, quite graciously, and
the chauffeur began sketching me. In three minutes
there I was&mdash;the "abominable little flirt!" in hat and
veil, with Lady Turnour's bag in my hand, quite a neat
figure of a motor maid.</p>

<p>"You may put, if you like, 'Lady Turnour's maid,'"
said that young person's mistress, "if you think it would
give some personal interest to your sketch for the paper."</p>

<p>"Oh, this is for quite a different sort of thing," he
explained. "Not devoted to society news at all: more
for caricatures and <i>funny</i> bits."</p>

<p>"Oh, then I should certainly not wish my name to
appear in <i>that</i>," returned her ladyship, her tone adding
that, on the other hand, such a publication was as suitable
as it was welcome to a portrait of <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>"Now, Elise, I wish you to take those things off at
<i>once</i>, and come to my room," she finished. "Mind, I
don't want you should keep me waiting! And you can
hand over that bag."</p>

<p>No hope of another word between us! Mr. Jack Dane
saw this, and that it would be unwise to try for it. Pocketing
the sketch-book, he saluted Lady Turnour with a
finger to the height of his eyebrows, which gesture visibly
added to her sense of importance. Then, without glancing
at me, he turned and walked off.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>It was not until he had disappeared round the bend of
the corridor that her ladyship thought it right to
leave me.</p>

<p>I knew that she had made this little expedition in search
of her maid with the sole object of seeing what the mouse
did while the cat was away&mdash;a trick worthy of her
lodging-house past! And I knew equally well that
before I tapped at her door a little later she had examined
the contents of the blue bag to make sure that I had
extracted nothing. How I pity the long procession of
"slaveys" who must have followed each other drearily
in that lodging-house under the landlady's jurisdiction.
They, poor dears, could have had no chauffeur friends to
save them from daily perils, and it isn't likely that their
mistress allowed such luxuries as postmen or policemen.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>I decided to have my breakfast very early next
morning, and would have thought it a coincidence
that Mr. Dane should walk into the couriers' room
at the same time if he hadn't coolly told me that he had
been lying in wait for me to appear.</p>

<p>"I thought, for several reasons, you would be early,"
he said. "So, for all the same reasons and several more,
I thought I'd be early too. I had to know what the
situation was to be."</p>

<p>"The situation?" I repeated blankly.</p>

<p>"Between us. Am I to understand that we've
quarrelled?"</p>

<p>"We had," I said. "But even on good grounds, it's
difficult to keep on quarrelling with a person who has not
only brought up your dinner and sauced it with good
advice, but saved you from&mdash;from the <i>dickens</i> of a
scrape."</p>

<p>"I hope she didn't row you any more afterward?"</p>

<p>"No. She was too much interested, all the time I was
undressing her, in speculating about Monsieur Charretier
to Sir Samuel. It seems that they struck up an acquaintance
over their coffee on the strength of a little episode
in the hall.</p>

<p>"Inadvertently I introduced them&mdash;threw them at
each others' heads. Monsieur Charretier&mdash;Alphonse,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>as he once asked me to call him!&mdash;told her he was on his
way to Cannes, where he heard that a friend of his, whom
it was very necessary for him to see, was visiting a Russian
Princess. He had stopped in Avignon, he said, because
he was expecting the latest news of the friend, a change
of address, perhaps; and&mdash;I don't know who proposed
it, but anyway he arranged to go with Sir Samuel and
Lady Turnour to the Palace of the Popes at ten o'clock.
Her ladyship was quite taken with him, and remarked
to Sir Samuel that there was nothing so fascinating as a
French gentleman of the <i>haut monde</i>. Also she pronounced
his broken English '<i>sweet</i>.' She wondered if
he was married, and whether the friend in Cannes was
a woman or a man. Little did she know that her maid
could have enlightened her! Their joining forces here
is, as my American friend Pamela would say, 'the <i>limit</i>.'"</p>

<p>"Don't worry. The Palace of the Popes won't see
him to-day," said the chauffeur. "He's gone. Got a
telegram. Didn't even wait for letters, but told the
manager to forward anything that came for him, Poste
Restante, Genoa."</p>

<p>"Oh, then you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Acted for you on my own responsibility. There was
nothing else to do, if <i>anything</i> were to be done; and you'd
seemed to fall in with my suggestion. It would have been
a pity, I thought, if your visit to Avignon were to be
spoiled by a thing like that."</p>

<p>"Meaning Monsieur Charretier? I hardly slept last
night for dwelling on the pity of it."</p>

<p>"It's all right, then? I haven't put my foot into it?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>"Your foot! You've put your <i>brains</i> into it. You
said the other night that I had presence of mind. It was
nothing to yours."</p>

<p>"All's forgotten and forgiven, then?"</p>

<p>"It's forgotten that there was anything to forgive."</p>

<p>"And the 'motor maid' business? You didn't think
it too clumsy?"</p>

<p>"I thought it most ingenious."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a lie, you know. I haven't a happy talent
for lying. I do, or rather did when I had nothing else
on hand, send occasional sketches to a paper. But the
more I look at my 'motor maid,' the more I feel I should
like to keep her&mdash;in my sketch-book&mdash;if you're willing
I should have her?"</p>

<p>"Then I don't get my promised five shillings?" I laughed.</p>

<p>"I'll try and make up the loss to you in some other way."</p>

<p>"I have you to thank that I didn't lose my situation.
So the debt is on my side."</p>

<p>"You owe me the scolding you got. I oughtn't to
have lured you into the corridor."</p>

<p>"It was on my business. And there was no other way."</p>

<p>"It was my business to have thought of some other way."</p>

<p>"Are you your sister's keeper?"</p>

<p>"I wish I&mdash;Look here, mademoiselle <i>ma soeur</i>,
I'm all out of repartees. Perhaps I shall be better after
breakfast. I shall be able to eat, now that I know you've
forgiven me."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you would care if I hadn't," I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>exclaimed. "You are so stolid, so phlegmatic, you
Englishmen!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so? Well, it would have been a little
awkward for me to have taken you about on a sightseeing
expedition this morning if we were at daggers
drawn&mdash;no matter how appropriate the situation might
have been to Avignon manners of the Middle Ages, when
everybody was either torturing everybody else or fighting
to the death."</p>

<p>"<i>Are</i> you going to take me about?"</p>

<p>"That's for you to say."</p>

<p>"Isn't it for Lady Turnour to say?"</p>

<p>"Sir Samuel told me last night that I shouldn't be
wanted till two o'clock, as he was going to see the town
with her ladyship. He wanted to know if we could sandwich
in something else this afternoon, as he considered
a whole day too much for one place. I suggested Vaucluse
for the afternoon, as it's but a short spin from Avignon,
and I just happened to mention that her ladyship might
find use for you there, to follow her to the fountain with
extra wraps in case of mistral. I thought, of all places
you'd hate to miss Vaucluse. And we're to come back
here for the night."</p>

<p>I feared that Monsieur Charretier's sudden disappearance
might upset the Turnours' plans, but Mr. Dane
didn't think so. He had impressed it upon Sir Samuel
that no motorist who had not thoroughly "done" Avignon
and Vaucluse would be tolerated in automobiling circles.</p>

<p>He was right in his surmise, and though her ladyship
was vexed at losing a new acquaintance whom it would
have been "nice to know in Paris," she resigned herself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>for the morning to the society of husband and Baedeker.
It was kind old Sir Samuel's proposal that I should be
left free to do some sight-seeing on my own account while
they were gone (I had meant to break my own shackles);
and though my lady laughed to scorn the idea that a girl
of my class should care for historical associations,
she granted me liberty provided I utilized it in buying
her certain stay-laces, shoe-strings, and other small horrors
for which no woman enjoys shopping.</p>

<p>When she and Sir Samuel were out of the way, as safely
disposed of as Monsieur Charretier himself, I felt so
extravagantly happy in reaction, after all my worries, that
I danced a jig in her ladyship's sacred bedchamber.</p>

<p>Then I prepared to start for my own personally conducted
expedition; and this time I took no great pains
to do my hair unbecomingly. Naturally, I didn't want
to be a jarring note in harmonious Avignon, so I made
myself look rather attractive for my jaunt with the
chauffeur.</p>

<p>He was sauntering casually about the <i>Place</i> before the
hotel, where long ago Marshal Brune was assassinated,
and we walked away together as calmly as if we had been
followed by a whole drove of well-trained chaperons.
When one has joined the ranks of the lower classes, one
might as well reap some advantages from the change!</p>

<p>"What we'll do," said Mr. Dane, "is to look first
at all the things the Turnours are sure to look at
last. By that plan we shall avoid them, and as I know
my way about Avignon pretty well, you may set your
mind at rest."</p>

<p>I can think of nothing more delightful than a day in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Avignon, with an agreeable brother and&mdash;a mind at rest.
I had both, and made the most of them.</p>

<p>When her ladyship's shoe-strings and stay-laces were
off my mind and in my coat pocket, we wandered leisurely
about the modern part of the wonderful town, which
has been busier through the centuries in making history
than almost any other in France. Seen by daylight, I
no longer resented the existence of a new&mdash;comparatively
new&mdash;Avignon. The pretty little theatre, with its
dignified statues of Corneill and Moli&egrave;re, seemed to invite
me kindly to go in and listen to a play by the splendidly
bewigged gentlemen sitting in stone chairs on either side
of the door. The clock tower with its "Jacquemart"
who stiffly struck the quarter hours with an automatic
arm, while his wife criticized the gesture, commanded
me to stop and watch his next stroke; and the curiosity
shops offered me the most alluring bargains. People
we met seemed to have plenty of time on their hands,
and to be very good-natured, as if rich Proven&ccedil;al cooking
agreed with their digestions.</p>

<p>Sure that the Turnours would be at the Palace of the
Popes or in the Cathedral, we went to the Museum, and
searched in vain among a riot of Roman remains for the
tomb of Petrarch's Laura, which guide-books promised.
In the end we had to be satisfied with a memorial cross
made in the lovely lady's honour by order of some romantic
Englishmen.</p>

<p>"Yet you say we're stolid and phlegmatic!" muttered
Mr. Dane, as he read the inscription. (Evidently that
remark had rankled.)</p>

<p>We had not a moment to waste, but the Turnours had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>to be avoided; so my brother proposed that we combine
profit with prudence, and take a cab along the road leading
out to Port St. Andr&eacute;. Where the ancient tower of
Philippe le Bel crowns a lower slope I should have
my first sight of that grim mountain of architecture, the
Palace of the Popes. It was the best place from which to
see it, if its real grandeur were to be appreciated, he said&mdash;or
else to go to Villeneuve, across the Rh&ocirc;ne, which
we dared not steal time to do; but the Turnours were
certain not to think of anything so esoteric in the way of
sight-seeing.</p>

<p>The vastness of the stupendous mass of brick and stone
took my breath away for an instant, as I raised my eyes
to look up, on a signal of "Now!" from Mr. Dane. It
seemed as if all the history, not alone of Old Provence,
but of France, might be packed away behind those
tremendous buttresses.</p>

<p>Of what romances, what tragedies, what triumphs, and
what despairs could those huge walls and towers tell, if
the echoes whispering through them could crystallize into words!</p>

<p>There Queen Jeanne of Naples&mdash;that fateful Marie
Stuart of Provence&mdash;stood in her youth and beauty
before her accusers, knowing she must buy her pardon,
if for pardon she could hope. There the wretched Bishop
of Cahors suffered tortures incredible for plots his enemies
vowed he had conceived against the Pope. There came
messages from Western Kings and Eastern Emperors;
there Bertrand du Guesclin, my favourite hero, was
excommunicated: and there great Rienzi lay in prison.</p>

<p>"Now I think we might risk going to the Palace," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Mr. Dane, when we had stood gazing in silence for more
minutes than we could well afford. So we made haste
back, and walked up to the Rochers des Doms, where we
lurked cautiously in the handsome modern gardens,
glorying in the view over the old and new bridges, and
to far off Villeneuve, where the Man in the Iron Mask
was first imprisoned. When we had admired the statue
of Althen the Persian, with his hand full of the beneficent
madder that did so much for Provence, we were rewarded
for our patience by seeing Sir Samuel and Lady Turnour
rush out from the Papal Palace, looking furious.</p>

<p>"They look like that, because they've been inside,"
said the chauffeur. "Their souls aren't artistic enough
to resent consciously the ruin and degradation of the
place, but even they can be depressed by the hideous
whitewashed barracks which were once splendid rooms,
worthy of kings. You will look as they do if
you go in."</p>

<p>"I hope my cheeks wouldn't be dark purple and my
nose a pale lilac!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You're twenty, at most, and Lady Turnour's forty-five,
at least," said my brother. "You can stand the pinch
of Mistral; but the inside of that noble old pile is enough
to turn the hair gray. It would be much more original
to let your imagination draw the picture."</p>

<p>"Then I will!" I cried, knowing that nothing pleases
a man more in a girl than taking his advice. By the lateness
of the hour we judged that the Turnours must have
visited the Cathedral before they "did" the Palace, so
we went boldly on to Notre Dame des Doms, beloved of
Charlemagne.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>No wonder, I said, that he had thought it worth restoring
from the ruins Saracens had left! Nothing could be
more glorious than the situation of the historic church,
once first in importance, perhaps, in all Christendom;
and nothing could be more purely classic than the west
porch. We strained the muscles of our necks staring
up at ancient, fading frescoes, and rested them again
in gazing at famous tombs; then it was time to go, if
we were not to start for Vaucluse too hungry to feed
satisfactorily on thoughts of Laura and Petrarch.</p>

<p>"Now to our own trough with the other beasts," I
sighed. "What an anti-climax! From the cathedral
to the couriers' dining-room."</p>

<p>"I thought that we might have our own private trough,
just this once, if you don't object," said the chauffeur,
almost wistfully. "It would be a shame to spoil the memory
of a perfect morning, wouldn't it, so don't you think
you might accept my humble invitation?"</p>

<p>I hesitated.</p>

<p>"Is it conventionality or economy that gives you
pause?" he asked. "If it's the latter, or rather a
regard for my pocket, your conscience can be easy. My
pocket feels heavy and my heart light to-day. I remember
a little restaurant not far off where they do you in
great style for a franc or two. Will you come with me?"</p>

<p>He looked quite eager, and I felt myself unable to
resist temptation. "Yes," said I, "and thank you."</p>

<p>A biting wind, more like March than flowery April,
nearly blew us down into the town, and I was glad to
find shelter in the warm, clean little restaurant.</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> my nose lilac after all?" I inquired, when a dear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>old smiling waiter had trotted off with our order, murmuring
benevolently, "Doude de zuide, M'sieur," like
a true compatriot of Tartarin.</p>

<p>"A faint pink from the cheeks is undeniably reflected
upon it," admitted the chauffeur. "We're going to
be let in for a cold snap as we get up north," he
went on. "I read in the papers this morning that
there's been a 'phenomenal fall of snow for the season'
on the Cevennes and the mountains of Auvergne. Do
you weaken on the Gorges of the Tarn now I've told
you that?"</p>

<p>"Mine not to reason why. Mine but to do or die," I
transposed, smiling with conspicuous bravery.</p>

<p>"Not at all. It's yours to choose. I haven't even
broken the Gorges, yet, to the slaves of my hypnotic
powers. I warn you that, if all the papers say about
snow is true, we may have adventures on the way. Would
you rather&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd rather have the adventures," I broke in, and
had as nearly as possible added "with you," but I
stopped myself in time.</p>

<p>We lunched more gaily than double-dyed millionaires,
and afterward, while my host was paying away his hard-earned
francs for our food, I slipped out of the restaurant
and into a little shop I had noticed close by. The window
was full of odds and ends, souvenirs of Avignon; and
there were picture-postcards, photographs, and coins
with heads of saints on them. In passing, on the way to
lunch, I'd noticed a silver St. Christopher, about the
size of a two-franc piece; and as the Aigle carries the
saint like a figure-head, a glittering, golden statuette six
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>or seven inches high, I had guessed that St. Christopher
must have been chosen to fill the honourable position
of patron saint for motors and motorists.</p>

<p>"What's the price of that?" I asked, pointing to the coin.</p>

<p>It was ten francs, a good deal more than I could afford,
more than half my whole remaining fortune. "Could not
madame make it a little cheaper?" I pleaded with the
fat lady whose extremely aquiline nose proclaimed that
she had no personal interest in saints. But no, madame
could not make it cheaper; the coin was of real silver,
the figure well chased; a recherch&eacute; little pocket-piece,
and a great luck-bringer for anybody connected with the
automobile. No accident would presume to happen to
one who carried <i>that</i> on his person. Madame had,
however, other coins of St. Christopher, smaller coins in
white metal which could scarcely be told from silver.
If mademoiselle wished to see them&mdash;</p>

<p>But mademoiselle did not wish to see them. It would
be worse than nothing to give a base imitation. Instead
of feeling flattered, St. Christopher would have a right
to be annoyed, and perhaps to punish. Recklessly I
passed across the counter ten francs, and made the
coveted saint mine. Then I darted out, just in time
to meet Mr. Dane at the door of the restaurant.</p>

<p>"This is for you," I said. "It's to give you luck."</p>

<p>I pressed the coin into his hand, and he looked at it
on his open palm. For an instant I was afraid he was
going to make fun of it, and my superstition concerning
it, which I couldn't quite deny if cross-questioned.
But his smile didn't mean that.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>"You've just bought this&mdash;to give to me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," I nodded.</p>

<p>"Why? Not because you want to 'pay me back' for
asking you to lunch&mdash;or any such villainous thing, I
hope, because&mdash;"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "I didn't think of that. I got it
because I wanted to bring you luck."</p>

<p>Then he slipped the coin into an inside pocket of his
coat. "Thank you," he said. "But didn't I tell you
that you'd brought me something better than luck already?"</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> better than luck?"</p>

<p>"An interest in life. And the privilege of being a brother."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>It would be a singularly hard-headed, cold-hearted
person who could set out for Vaucluse without the
smallest thrill; and hard heads and cold hearts don't
"run in our family." As we spun away from the Hotel
de l'Europe soon after two o'clock that afternoon I
felt that I was largely composed of thrill. Cold as the
wind had grown, the thrill kept me warm, mingling in
my veins with ozone.</p>

<p>Inside the car the middle-aged honeymooners had an
air of desperate resignation which the consciousness of
doing their duty according to Baedeker gives to tourists.
The tap was turned on in the newly invented heating-apparatus
in the car floor, through which hot water
from the radiator can be made to circulate; and I wondered,
if this extreme measure were resorted to already,
what would be left to do when we reached those high,
white altitudes of which the chauffeur had been speaking.
I prayed that Lady Turnour might not read in the papers
about the "phenomenal fall of snow" in those regions,
for if she did I was afraid that even Mr. Dane's
magnetic powers of persuasion might fail to get her
there. He might dangle Queen Margherita of Italy
over her head in vain, if worst came to worst: for
what are queens to the most inveterate tuft-hunters if
the feet be cold? Yet now that "adventures" were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>vaguely prophesied, I felt I could not give up the
promised gorges and mountains.</p>

<p>Out of Avignon we slid, past the old, old ramparts and
the newer but impressive walls, and turned at the right
into the Marseilles road. "Vaucluse!" said a kilometre-stone,
and then another and another repeated that
enchanted and enchanting word, as we flew onward
between the Rh&ocirc;ne and the Durance.</p>

<p>This was our own old way again, as far as the Pont de
Bonpas; then our road wound to the northeast, away
from the world we knew&mdash;I said to myself&mdash;and into
a world of romance, a world created by the love of Petrarch
for Laura, and sacred to those two for ever more.</p>

<p>The ruined castle, with machicolated towers and
haughty buttresses, on the great rampart of a hill, was
for me the porter's lodge at the entrance gate of an
enchanted garden, where poetic flowers of love bloomed
through seasons and centuries; laurels, roses, and lilies,
and pansies for remembrance. We didn't see those
flowers with our bodies' eyes, but what of that? What
did it matter that to the Turnours in their splendid glass
cage this was just a road, with queer little gnome dwellings
scooped out of solid rock to redeem it from common-placeness,
with a fringe of deserted cottages farther
on, and some ugly brickworks? My spirit's eyes saw the
flowers, and they clustered thicker and brighter about
Pieverde, where I insisted to Mr. Dane that Laura had
been born.</p>

<p>He was inclined to dispute this at first, and bring up
the horrid theory that the pure white star of Petrarch's
life had been a mere Madame de Sade, with a drove of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>uninteresting children. But eagerly I quoted Petrarch
himself, using all the arguments on which Pamela and
I prided ourselves at the Convent; and by the time
we had got as far as that sweet "little Venice full of
water wheels," L'Isle, I'd persuaded him to agree with
me. In the midst of all that lovely, liquid music of running,
trickling, fluting water, who could go on callously
insisting that Laura resisted Petrarch merely because
she was a fat married woman with a large family?</p>

<p>All was green and pastoral here, and we seemed to
have come into eternal spring after the bleak, windy
plains encircling Avignon. It was beautiful to remember
Petrarch's description of his golden-haired, dark-eyed
love, fair and tall as a lily, sitting in the grass among
the violets, where her bare feet gleamed whiter than
the daisies when she took off her sandals. Even Nicolete,
flower of Proven&ccedil;al song, had no whiter feet than Laura,
I am sure!</p>

<p>We were slipping past the banks of a little river, clear
as sapphires and emeralds melted and mingled together.
The sound of its singing drowned the sound of the motor,
so that we seemed to glide toward Vaucluse noiselessly
and reverently.</p>

<p>At the Inn of Petrarch and Laura the car had to
stop; and looking up, we could see on the height above
the castle home of Petrarch's dearest friend, Philippe de
Cabassole, guardian of Queen Jeanne of Naples. Up
there on the cliff Petrarch's eyes must often have turned
toward Pieverde with longing thoughts of Laura, that
"white dove" who was always for him sixteen, as when
he met her first.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>No farther than the inn could any wheeled thing go;
and having justified my presence by buttoning Lady
Turnour up in her coat, and finding her muff under
several rugs, I stood by the car, gazing after the couple
as they trudged off along the path to the hidden fairy
fountain of Vaucluse. When they should have got well
ahead I meant to go too, for if a cat may look at a king,
a lady's maid may try to drink&mdash;if she can&mdash;a few drops
from the cup of a great poet's inspiration. At first I
resented those two ample, richly clad, prosaic backs
marching sturdily toward the magic fountain; then suddenly
the back of Sir Samuel became pathetic in my
eyes. Hadn't he, I asked myself, loved his Emily
("Emmie, pet," as I've heard him call her) as long and
faithfully as Petrarch loved his Laura? Perhaps, after
all, he had earned the right to visit this shrine.</p>

<p>Rocks shut out from our sight the distant fountain,
and the last windings of the path that led to it, clasping
the secret with great stone arms, like those of an Othello
jealously guarding his young wife's beauty from eyes profane.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going now?" asked my brother, with a
certain wistfulness.</p>

<p>"Ye-es. But what about you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've been here before, you know."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe in second times? Or is a second
time always second best?"</p>

<p>"Not when&mdash;Of course I want to go. But I can't
leave the car alone."</p>

<p>My eyes wandered toward the inn door. "There's
a boy there who looks as if he were born to be a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>watch-dog," said I, basely tempting him. "Couldn't you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I couldn't," he said decidedly. "At a place like
this, where there are a lot of tourists about, it wouldn't
be right. It was different at Valescure, when I took
you in to lunch."</p>

<p>"You mean I mustn't make that a precedent."</p>

<p>"I don't mean anything conceited."</p>

<p>"But you won't desert Mr. Micawber. I believe I
shall name the car Micawber! Well, then, I must go
by myself&mdash;and if I should fall into the fountain and
be drowned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense, and don't do anything foolish,"
said Mr. Dane, sternly, whereupon I turned my back
upon him, and plunged into the cool shadows of the
gorge. The great white cliff of limestone was my goal,
and always it towered ahead, as I followed the narrow
pathway above the singing water. I sighed as I paused
to look at a garden which maybe once was Petrarch's,
for it was sad to find my way to fairyland, alone. Even
a brother's company would have been better than none,
I thought!</p>

<p>Soon I met my master and mistress coming back.</p>

<p>There was nothing much to see, said her ladyship,
sharply, and I mustn't be long; but Sir Samuel ventured
to plead with her.</p>

<p>"Let the girl have ten minutes or so, if she likes, dear,"
said he. "We'll be wanting a cup of hot coffee at the
inn. And it is a pretty place." There was something
in his voice which told me that he would have felt the
charm&mdash;if his bride had let him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>Pools of water, deep among the rocks, were purple-pansy
colour or beryl green; but the "Source" itself,
in its cup of stone, was like a block of malachite. There
was no visible bubbling of underground springs fighting
their way up to break the crystal surface of the fountain,&mdash;this
fountain so unlike any other fountain; but to the
listening ear came a moaning and rushing of unseen
waters, now the high crying of Arethusa escaping from
her pursuing lover, now rich, low notes as of an organ
played in a vast cavern.</p>

<p>Above the gorge, the towering rocks with their huge
holes and archways hollowed out by turbulent water
in dim, forgotten ages, looked exactly as if the whole
front wall had been knocked off a giant's castle, exposing
its secret labyrinths of rough-hewn rooms, floor rising
above floor even to the attics where the giant's servants
had lived, and down to the cellars where the giant's pet
dragons were kept in chains.</p>

<p>I hadn't yet exhausted my ten minutes, though I began
to have a guilty consciousness that they would soon be
gone, when I heard a step behind me, and turning, saw
Mr. Dane.</p>

<p>"They're having coffee in the car," he said. "Sir
Samuel proposed it to his wife, as if he thought it would
be rather more select and exclusive for her than drinking
it in the inn; but I have a sneaking suspicion that it
was because he wanted to let me off. Not a bad old
boy, Sir Samuel."</p>

<p>So we saw the fountain of Vaucluse together, after all.
I don't know why that should have seemed important
to me, but it did&mdash;a little.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>We didn't say much to each other, all the way back to
Avignon, but I felt that the day had been a brilliant
success, and was sure that the next could not be as good.
"What&mdash;not with St. Remy and Les Baux?" exclaimed
my brother. But I knew very little about St. Remy,
and still less about Les Baux. For a minute I was
ashamed to confess, but then I told myself that this was
a much worse kind of vanity than being pleased with the
colour of one's hair or the length of one's eyelashes. Mr.
Jack Dane was too polite to show surprise at my ignorance;
but that evening, just as I was getting ready to go
down to dinner, up he came with a tray, as he had the
night before; and on the tray, among covered dishes, was a book.</p>

<p>"Two of your chauffeur-admirers from Aix are in the
dining-room," he said, "so I thought you'd rather stop
up in your room and read T.A. Cook's 'Old Provence,'
than go downstairs. Anyway, it will be better for you."</p>

<p>I was half angry, half flattered that he should arrange
my life for me in this off-hand way, whether I liked it or
not; but the French half of me will do almost anything
rather than be ungracious; and it would have been
ungracious to say I was tired of dining in my room, and
could take care of myself, when he had given himself
the trouble of carrying up my dinner. So I swallowed
all less obvious emotions than meek gratitude for food,
physical and mental; and was soon so deeply absorbed
in the delightful book that I forgot to eat my pudding.
I sat up late with it&mdash;the book, not the pudding&mdash;after
putting Lady Turnour to bed (almost literally,
because she thinks it refined to be helpless), and when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>morning came I was no longer disgracefully ignorant of
St. Remy and Les Baux.</p>

<p>Mr. Dane had mapped out the programme of places
to see, using Avignon as a centre, and there were so
many notabilities at the Hotel de l'Europe following
the same itinerary, with insignificant variations, that
Lady Turnour was quite contented with the arrangements
made for her.</p>

<p>Morning was for St. Remy; afternoon was for Les Baux,
"because the thing is to see the sunset there," I heard
her telling an extremely rich-looking American lady,
laying down the law as if she had planned the whole trip
herself, with a learned reason for each detail.</p>

<p>The way to St. Remy was along a small but pretty
country road, which had a misleading air, as if it didn't
want you to think it was taking you to a place of any
importance. And yet we were in the heart of Mistral-land;
not Mistral the east wind, but Mistral the poet
of Provence, great enough to be worthy of the land he
loves, great enough to carry on the glory of it to future
generations. At any moment we might meet a Fellore.
I looked with interest at each man we saw, and some
looked back at me with flattering curiosity; for a
woman's eyes are almost as mysterious behind a three-cornered
talc window as behind a yashmak, or zenana gratings.</p>

<p>St. Remy itself&mdash;birthplace of Nostradamus, maker
of powders and prophecies&mdash;was charming in the sunlight,
with its straight avenue of trees like the pillars of
a long gray and green corridor in a vast palace; but we
swept on toward the "Plateau des Antiquities," up a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>steep slope with St. Remy the modern at our backs;
then suddenly I found myself crying out with delight
at sight of the splendid Triumphal Archway and the
gracious Monument we had come out to see.</p>

<p>Both looked more Greek than Roman, but that was
because Greek workmen helped to build them for Julius
C&aelig;sar, when he determined that posterity should not
forget his defeat of great Vercingetorix, and should do
justice to the memory of Marius.</p>

<p>When I was small I used to dislike poor Vercingetorix,
and be glad that he had to surrender, so that I might be
rid of him, owing to the dreadful difficulty of pronouncing
his name; but when we had got out of the
car, and I saw him on the archway, a tall, carved
captive, who had kept his head through all the
centuries, while C&aelig;sar (with a hand on the prisoner's
shoulder) had lost his, my heart softened to him for the
first time.</p>

<p>I thought the Triumphal Monument to Marius even
more beautiful than the Archway, and felt as angry as
Marius must, that the guide-books should take it away
from the hero and wrongfully call it a mausoleum for
somebody else. But Mr. Dane assured me with the
obstinate air people have when learned authorities back
their opinions, that the Arch was really the more interesting
of the two&mdash;the first Triumphal Archway set up
outside Italy, said he, and bade me reflect on that; still,
I would turn my eyes toward the graceful monument,
so wickedly annexed by the three Julii, and then away
over the wide plain that lay beneath this ragged spur
of the Alpilles. In the distance I could see Avignon,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>and the pale, opal-tinted, gold-veined hills that fold in
the fountain of Vaucluse. Never, since we came into
Provence, had I been able so clearly to realize the wild
fascination of her haggard beauty. "Here Marius
stood in his camp," I thought, "shading his eyes from
the fierce sun, and looking out over this strange, arid
country for the Barbarians he meant to conquer." My
heart beat with an intoxicating excitement, such as one
feels on seeing great mountains or the ocean for the first
time; and then down I tumbled, with a bump, off my
pedestal, when Lady Turnour wanted to know what I
supposed she'd brought me for, if not to put on her
extra cloak without waiting to be told.</p>

<p>Watches are really luxuries, not necessities, with the
Turnours, because their appetites always strike the
hour of one, and if they're sometimes a little in advance,
they can be relied upon never to be behindhand. I knew
before I glanced at the little bracelet-watch Pamela gave
me (hidden under my sleeve) that it must be on the stroke
of half-past twelve when her ladyship began to complain
of the sharp wind, and say we had better be getting back
to St. Remy. She was cross, as usual when she is hungry,
and said that if I continued to go about "like a snail in a
dream" whenever she fetched me to carry her things on
these short expeditions, she would leave me in the hotel to
mend her clothes; whereupon I became actually servile
in my ministrations. I brushed a microscopic speck of
dust off her gown; I pushed in a hairpin; I tucked up a
flying end of veil; I straightened her toque, and made
myself altogether indispensable; for the bare idea of
being left behind was a box on the ear. I could not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>endure such a punishment&mdash;and the front seat would
look so empty, so unfinished, without me!</p>

<p>As we went back down the steep hill from old Glanum,
St. Remy appeared a little oasis of spring in the midst
of a winter which had come back for something it had
forgotten. All its surrounding orchards and gardens,
screened from the shrewish Mistral by the shoulders of
the Alpilles, and again by lines of tall cypress trees and
netted, dry bamboos, had begun to bloom richly like
the earlier gardens on the Riviera. There was a pinky-white
haze of apple blossoms; and even the plane trees
in the long main street were hung with dainty, primrose-coloured
spheres, like little fairy lanterns. Not only
did every man seem a possible Felibre, but every girl was
a beauty. Some of them wore a charming and becoming
head-dress, such as I never saw before, and the chauffeur
said it was the head-dress of the women of Arles,
where we would go day after to-morrow.</p>

<p>Impertinent chauffeurs or couriers would have been
more out of place in poetic St. Remy than the sensational
Nostradamus himself; and there was no trouble of that
sort for me in lunching at the pleasant, quiet hotel. Mr.
Dane had bought a French translation of Mistral's
"Memoires," and as we ate, he and I alone together,
he read me the incident of the child-poet and his three
wettings in quest of the adored water-flowers. Nothing
could be more beautiful than the wording of the exquisite
thoughts, yet I wished we could have seen those thoughts
embodied in Proven&ccedil;al, the language practically created
by Mistral, as Italian was by Dante and Petrarch, or
German by Goethe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>Not far away lay Mas du Juge, described in the book,
where he was born, and Maillane, where he lives, and I
longed to drive that way; but as the Turnours would
be sure to say that there was nothing to see, the chauffeur
thought it wiser not to turn out of our road. We might
find the poet at Arles, perhaps, in his museum there, or
lunching at the Hotel du Forum, a favourite haunt of
his on museum days.</p>

<p>Starting for Les Baux, we turned our faces straight
toward the wild little mountains loved by Mistral, his
dear Alpilles. They soon surrounded us in tumbling
gray waves, piled up on either side of the road as the
Red Sea must have tumultuously fenced in the path of
the Israelites. Strange, hummocky mountains were
everywhere, as far as we could see; mountains of incredible,
nightmare shapes, and of great ledges set with
gigantic busts of ancient heroes, some nobly carved,
some hideously caricatured, roughly hewn in gray limestone,
or red rock that looked like bronze. On we
went, climbing up and up, a road like a python's back;
but not yet was there any glimpse of the old "robber
fortress" of Les Baux about which I had read, and later
dreamed, last night. I knew it would be wonderful,
astonishing, a Dead City, a Pompeii of the Feudal Age,
yet different from any other ancient town the whole
world over&mdash;a place of tangled histories; yet I tried
vainly to picture what it would be like. Then, suddenly,
we reached a turn in that strange road which, if
it had led downhill instead of up, would have seemed
like the way Orpheus took to reach Hades.</p>

<p>We had come face to face with a huge chasm in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>rock, a gap with sheer walls sliced clean down, like a
cut in a great cheese; and I felt instinctively that this
must be the dark doorway through which we should
see Les Baux.</p>

<p>Through the cut in the stone cheese our road carried
us; and the busts on the rocky ledges were so near now
we could almost have put out our hands and touched
them&mdash;but curiously enough, in this place of all others,
they were the likenesses of modern men. Mr. Dane
and I picked out an unmistakable Gladstone on the
right, a characteristic Beaconsfield on the left; and
farther on Mr. Chamberlain's head was fantastically
grafted on to the body of a prehistoric animal. We were
just tracing Pierpont Morgan's profile, near a few of
Hannibal's elephants, when the car sprang clear of the
chasm, out upon the other side of the doorway; and
there rose before us Les Baux, a hundred times more
wonderful, more tragic, than I had hoped to find it.</p>

<p>Far, far below our mountain road lay a valley so flat
that it might have been levelled on purpose for the tilting
of knights in great tournaments. Above and around us
(for suddenly we were in as well as under it) was a City
of Ghosts.</p>

<p>Huge masses of rock, like Titan babies' playthings,
had been hollowed out for dwellings, fit houses for our late
cousins the cave-dwellers. There were colossal pillars
and dark, high doorways such as one sees in pictures
of the temples at Thebes; but all this, said Mr. Jack
Dane, was merely a preface for what was yet to come, only
an immense quarry whence the stones to build Les Baux
had been torn. We were still on the road to the real Les<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Baux; and even as he spoke, the Aigle was clawing her
way bravely up a hill steeper than any we had mounted.
At the top she turned abruptly, and stopped in a queer,
forlorn little place, where to my astonishment our journey
ended in front of a small house ambitiously named
Hotel Monte Carlo. Then I remembered the story
I had read: how a young prince of the Grimaldi family
came begging Louis XIII. to protect him from Spain;
how Louis, who didn't want Spain to grab Monaco,
promptly gave soldiers; how the Grimaldi's shrewd wit
did more to get the Spanish out of the little principality
than did the fighting men from France; and how Louis,
as a reward, turned poor, war-worn Les Baux into a
Grimaldi marquisate.</p>

<p>That little episode in history accounted for the Hotel
Monte Carlo; and I wondered if it were put up on the
site of the Grimaldis' miniature pleasure-palace, which
the forest-burning revolutionists tore down just before
Les Baux, after all its strange passings from hand to
hand, became the property of the nation.</p>

<p>Against the rocks a few mean houses leaned apologetically,
but on every side rose the ruins of a proud, dead
past: a past beginning with the ruts of chariot-wheels
graven on the rock-paved street. I thought, as I looked
at the sordid little village of to-day, which had crawled
into the very midst of the fortress, of some words I'd
read last night: "a rat in the heart of a dead princess."</p>

<p>Strange, haggard hill, whispered about by history ever
since Christians ran before Alaric the Visigoth, and hid
in its caverns already echoing with legends of mysterious
Phoenician treasure! Strange robber house of Les Baux,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>founded thirteen hundred years ago, and claiming half
Provence two centuries later! No wonder, after all the
fighting and plundering, loving and hating, that all it asks
now is for its bleached, picked bones to be left in peace!</p>

<p>I thought this, standing by the little Hotel Monte
Carlo, waiting for my mistress and her husband to be
supplied with a guide. He was the most intelligent and
efficient-seeming guide imaginable, who looked as if he had
the whole history of Les Baux behind his bright dark eyes;
and I hoped that the humble maid and chauffeur might
be allowed to follow the "quality" within respectful
earshot.</p>

<p>Soon they began to walk on, and I turned to look at
my brother, who was lingering by the car. Already the
guide had begun to be interesting. I caught a few words:
"Celtic caverns"&mdash;"Leibulf, the first Count"&mdash;"the
terrible Turenne, called the 'Fl&eacute;au de Provence'&mdash;the
Lady Alix's guardian"&mdash;which made me long to hear
more; but I didn't want to crawl on until my Fellow
Worm could crawl with me.</p>

<p>"I can't go," he said. "It wouldn't do to leave the
car here. There are several gipsy faces at the inn window,
you see. Why there should be gipsies I don't know;
but there are, for those are gipsies or I'll eat my cap.
And I've got to keep watch on deck."</p>

<p>"How horrid to leave you here alone, seeing nothing&mdash;not
even the sunset!" I exclaimed. "I think I shall stop
with you, unless <i>she</i> calls me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," he had begun, when
the summons came, sooner than I had expected.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>"Elise, come here and put what this guide is
saying into English," was the command, and I
flew to obey. To hear him tell what he knew
was like turning over the leaves of the Book of Les Baux;
and I tried to do him justice in my translation; but it was
disheartening to see Lady Turnour's lack-lustre gaze
wander as dully about the rock-hewn barracks of Roman
soldiers as if she had been in her own lodging-house
cellar, and to be interrupted by her complaints of the cold
wind as we went up the silent streets, past deserted
palaces of dead and gone nobles, toward the crown of
all&mdash;the Ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>Nothing moved her to any show of interest in this
grave of mighty memories, of mighty warrior princes,
and of lovely ladies with names sweet as music and perfume
of potpourri. Wandering in a splendid confusion
of feudal and medi&aelig;val relics&mdash;walls with carved doorways,
and doorways without walls; beautiful, purposeless
columns whose occupation had long been gone; carved
marvels of fireplaces standing up sadly from wrecked
floors of fair ladies' boudoirs or great banqueting halls,
the stout, painted woman broke in upon the guide's story
to talk of any irrelevant matter that jumped into her
mind. She suddenly bethought herself to scold Sir
Samuel about "Bertie," from whom a letter had evidently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>been forwarded, and who had been spending too much
money to please her ladyship.</p>

<p>"That stepson of yours is a regular bad egg," said she.</p>

<p>"Never you mind," retorted Sir Samuel, defending
his favourite. "Many a bad egg has turned over a
new leaf."</p>

<p>My lip quivered, but I fixed my eyes firmly upon the
guide, who was now devoting his attention entirely to
his one respectful listener. I was ashamed of my companions,
but I couldn't help catching stray fragments of
the conversation, and the involuntary mixing of Bertie's
affairs with the Religious Wars, and the destruction of
Les Baux by Richelieu's soldiers, had a positively weird
effect on my mind. Bertie, it seemed&mdash;(or was it
Richelieu?) was invited to visit at the ch&acirc;teau of a French
marquis called de Roquemartine (or was it good King
Ren&eacute;, who inherited Les Baux because he was a count
of Provence?), and the ch&acirc;teau was near Clermont-Ferrand.
Lady Turnour was of opinion that it would
be well to make a condition before sending the cheque
which Bertie wanted to pay his bridge debts (or was
he in debt because the Lady Douce and her sister Stephanette
of Les Baux had quarrelled?). If the advice of
Dane, the chauffeur, were taken, they would be motoring
to Clermont-Ferrand; and why not say to Bertie: "No
cheque unless you get us an invitation to visit the Roquemartines
while you are there?" (Or was it that they
wanted an invitation to the boudoir of Queen Jeanne,
Ren&eacute;'s beloved wife, who lived at Les Baux sometimes,
and had very beautiful things around her&mdash;tapestries and
Eastern rugs, and wondrous rosaries, and jewelled Books
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>of Hours?) Really, it was very bewildering; but in my
despair one drop of comfort fell. That ch&acirc;teau near
Clermont-Ferrand would prove a lodestar, and help Mr.
Jack Dane to lure the Turnours through chill gorges and
over snowy mountains.</p>

<p>"Lodestar" really was a good word for the attraction,
I thought, and I would repeat it to the chauffeur. But it
rose over the horizon of my intellect probably because the
guide talked of Countess Alix, last heiress of the great
House of Les Baux. "As she lay dying," he said, "the star
that had watched over and guided the fortunes of her
house came down from the sky, according to the legend,
and shone pale and sad in her bedchamber till she was
dead. Then it burst, and its light was extinguished in
darkness for ever."</p>

<p>Eventually Sir Samuel's eye brightened for the Tudor
rose decoration, in the ruined ch&acirc;teau, relic of an alliance
between an English princess and the House of Les Baux;
and Lady Turnour didn't interrupt once when the guide
told of the latest important discovery in the City of Ghosts.
"Near the altar of the Virgin here," he began, in just the
right, hushed tone, "they found in a tomb the body of
a beautiful young girl. There she lay, as the tomb was
opened, just for an instant&mdash;long enough for the eye to
take in the picture&mdash;as lovely as the loveliest lady of
Les Baux, that famed princess Cecilie, known through
Provence as Passe-Rose. Her long golden hair was in two
great plaits, one over either shoulder, and her hands
were crossed upon her breast, holding a Book of Hours.
But in a second, as the air touched her, she was gone like
a dream; her sweet young face, white as milk, and half
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>smiling, her long dark eyelashes, even the Book of Hours,
all crumbled into dust, fine as powder. Only the golden
hair, tied with blue ribbon, was left; and when you go
to Arles you can see it in the Museum of Monsieur
Mistral."</p>

<p>"Make a note of hair for Arles, Sam," said her ladyship,
gravely; and just as solemnly he obeyed, scribbling
a few words in the pocket memorandum-book in which
the poor man industriously puts down all the things which
his wife thinks he ought to remember.</p>

<p>"Anything else interesting ever been found here?"
she wanted to know. "Any jewels or things of that
sort?"</p>

<p>I passed the question on to the guide.</p>

<p>Many things had been found, he said: coins, vases,
pottery, and mosaics. Occasionally such things were
turned up, though usually, nowadays, of no great value;
but it was the hope of finding something which brought
the gipsies. Often there were gypsies at Les Baux. They
would go to Les Saintes Maries, the place of the sacred
church where the two sainted Maries came ashore from
Palestine in their little boat, and they would pray to
Sarah, whose tomb was also in that wonderful church.
Had we seen it yet? No? But it was not far. Many
people went, though the great day was on May twenty-fourth,
when the Archbishop of Aix lowered the ark of
relics from the roof, and healed those of the sick who were
true believers. It was for Sarah, though, that the gipsies
made their pilgrimages. They thought that prayers at
her tomb would bring them whatever they desired; and
sometimes, when they were able to come on as far as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Les Baux, they would wish at the tomb to find the buried
Phoenician treasure, for which many had searched
generation after generation, since history began, but
none had ever found.</p>

<p>I did not say anything about the gipsies at the inn-window,
but I saw now that Mr. Dane had done wisely
in sticking to his post. A sixty-horse-power Aigle might
largely make up for a disappointment in the matter of
treasure, even if she had to be towed down into the valley
by a horse.</p>

<p>"Calv&eacute;, and all the great singers, come here sometimes
by moonlight in their motors," went on the guide, "after
the great musical festival of Orange in the month of
August. They stand on the piles of stone among the
ruins when all is white under the moon, and they sing&mdash;ah!
but they sing! It is wonderful. They do it for their
own pleasure, and there is no audience except the ghosts&mdash;and
me, for they allow me to listen. Yet I think, if
our eyes could be opened to such things, we would see
grouped round a noble company of knights and ladies&mdash;such
a company as would be hard to get together in
these days."</p>

<p>"Well, I would rather sing here in August than April!"
exclaimed Lady Turnour, with the air of a spoiled prima
donna. And then she shivered and wanted to go down
to the car without waiting for the sunset, which, after
all, could only be like any other mountain sunset, and
she could see plenty of better ones next summer in Switzerland.
She felt so chilled, she was quite anxious about
herself, and should certainly not dare to start for Avignon
until she had had a glass of steaming hot rum punch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>or something of that sort, at the inn. Did the guide
think she could get it&mdash;and have it sent out to her in the
car, as nothing would induce her to go inside that
little den?</p>

<p>The guide thought it probable that something hot
might be obtained, though there might be a few minutes'
delay while the water was made to boil, as it would be
an unusual order.</p>

<p>A few minutes! thought I, eagerly, looking at the
sun, which was hurrying westward. I knew what "a
few minutes" at such an inn would mean&mdash;half an hour
at least; and apparently I was no longer needed as an
interpreter. Without a thought of me, now that I had
ceased to be useful, Lady Turnour slipped her arm into
her husband's for support (her high-heeled shoes and
the rough, steep streets had not been made for each other),
and began trotting down the hill, in advance of the guide.
They had finished with him, too, and were already deep in
a discussion as to whether rum punch, or hot whisky-and-water
with sugar and lemon were better, for warding
off a chill. I didn't see why I shouldn't linger a little
on the wide plateau, with the Dead City looming above
me like a skeleton seated on a ruined throne, and half
southern France spread out in a vast plain, a thousand
feet below.</p>

<p>It was wonderful there, and strangely, almost terribly
still. Once the sea had washed the feet of the cliff, dim
ages ago. Now my eyes had to travel far to the Mediterranean,
where Marseilles gloomed dark against the
burnished glimmer of the water. I could see the Etang
de Berre, too, and imagine I saw the Aurelian Way, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>gloomy old Aigues-Mortes, which we were to visit later.
At lunch we had talked of a poem of Mistral's, which a
friend of Mr. Dane's had put into French&mdash;a poem all
about a legendary duel. And it was down there, in that
far-stretching field, that the duel was fought.</p>

<p>As I looked I realized that the clouds boiling up from
some vast cauldron behind the world were choking the
horizon with their purple folds. They were beautiful
as the banners of a royal army advancing over the horizon,
but&mdash;they would hide the sun as he went down to bathe
in the sea. He was embroidering their edges with gold
now. I was seeing the best at this moment. If I started
to go back, I should have time to pause here and there,
gazing at things the Turnours had hurried past.</p>

<p>I went down slowly, reluctantly, the melancholy charm
of the place catching at my dress as I walked, like the
supplicating fingers of a ghost condemned to dumbness.
There was one rock-hewn house I had wanted to see,
coming up, which Lady Turnour had scorned, saying
"when you've been in one, you've been in all."
And she had not understood the guide's story of a legend
that was attached to this particular house. Perhaps
if she had she would not have cared; but now I was
free I couldn't resist the temptation of going in, to
poke about a little. You could go several floors down,
the guide had said; that was certain, but the tale was,
that a secret way led down from the lowest cellar of this
cave house, continuing&mdash;if one could only find it&mdash;to
the enchanted cavern far below, where Taven, the witch,
kept and cured of illness the girl loved by Mireio.</p>

<p>I didn't know who Mireio was, except that he lived in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>songs and legends of Old Provence, but the story sounded
like a beautiful romance; and then, the guide had added
that some people thought the Kabre d'Or, or Phoenician
treasure, was hidden somewhere between Les Baux and
the "Fairy Grotto," or the "Gorge of Hell," near by.</p>

<p>Caves have always had the most extraordinary, magical
fascination for me. When I was a child, I believed that
if I could only go into one I should be allowed to find
fairyland; and even in an ordinary, every-day cellar
I was never quite without hope. The smell of a cellar
suggested the most cool, delightful, shadowy mysteries
to me, at that time, and does still.</p>

<p>It was as if the ghostly hand that had been pulling
me back, begging me not to leave Les Baux, led me
gently but insistently through the doorway of the rock
house.</p>

<p>It was not yet dark inside. I tiptoed my way through
some rough bits of debris, to the back of the big room,
crudely cut out of stone. There were shelves where the
dwellers had set lights or stored provisions, and there
was nothing else to see except a square hole in the floor,
below which a staircase had been hewn. A glimmer of
light came up to me, gray as a bat's wing, and I knew
that there must be some opening for ventilation below.</p>

<p>I felt that I would give anything to go down those
rough stone stairs, only half way down, perhaps; just
far enough to see what lay underneath. It was as if
Taven herself had called me, saying: "Come, I have
something to show you."</p>

<p>I put a foot on the first step, then the other foot wanted
a chance to touch the next step, and so on, each demanding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>its own turn in fairness. I had gone down eight steps,
counting each one, when I heard a faint rustling noise.
I stopped, my heart giving a jump, like a bird in a cage.</p>

<p>There were no windows in the underground room,
which was much smaller and less regular in shape than
the one above, but a faint twilight seemed to rain down
into it in streaks, like spears of rain, and I guessed that
holes had been made in the rock to give light and ventilation.
Something alive was down there, moving.
I was frightened; I hardly dared to look. And I had a
nightmare feeling of being struck dumb and motionless.
I tried to turn and run up the stairs but I had to look,
and the gray filtering light struck into a pair of eyes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p>They were great black eyes, sunken into the face
of an old woman. She stood in a corner, and
it occurred to me that she had perhaps run
there, as much afraid of me as I was of her. No eyes
were ever like those, I thought, except the eyes of
a gipsy.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" I stammered, in French,
hardly expecting her to understand and answer me; but
she replied in an old, cracked voice that sounded hollow
and unreal in the cavern.</p>

<p>"I have been asleep," she said. "I am waiting for
my sons. We are in Les Baux on business. I thought,
when I heard you, it was my boys coming to fetch
me. I can't go till they are here, because I have
dropped my rosary with a silver crucifix down below,
and the way is too steep for me. They must get it."</p>

<p>"Do they know you are here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she returned. "They will come at six.
We shall perhaps have our supper and sleep in this house
to-night. Then we will go away in the morning."</p>

<p>"It is only a little after five now," I told her. "You
frightened me at first."</p>

<p>She cackled a laugh. "I am nothing to be afraid of,"
she chuckled. "I am very old. Besides, there is no harm
in me. If you have the time, I could tell your fortune."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>"I'm afraid I haven't time," I said, though I was
tempted. To have one's fortune told in a cavern under
a rock house where Romans had lived, told by a real,
live gipsy who looked as if she might be a lineal descendant
from Taven, and who was probably fresh from worshipping
at the tomb of Sarah! It would be an experience.
No girl I knew, not even Pam herself, who is always
having adventures, could ever have had one as good as
this. If only I need not miss it!</p>

<p>"It would take no more than five minutes," she pleaded
in her queer French, which was barely understandable,
and evidently not the tongue in which she was most at
home.</p>

<p>"Well, then," I said, hastily calculating that it was no
more than ten minutes since Lady Turnour and Sir
Samuel left me, and that the water for their punch
couldn't possibly have begun to boil yet. "Well, then,
perhaps I might have five minutes' fortune, if it
doesn't cost too much; but I'm very poor&mdash;poorer
than you, maybe."</p>

<p>"That cannot be, for then you would have less than
nothing," said the old woman, cackling again. "But it
is your company I like to have, more than your money.
I have been waiting here a long time, and I am dull. No
fortune can be expected to come true, however, unless the
teller's hand be crossed with silver, otherwise I might give
it you for nothing. But a two-franc piece&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think I have as much as that," I cut her short, as
she paused on the hint; and deciding not to ask her, as
I felt inclined, to come to the upper room lest we should
be interrupted, I went down the remaining five or six
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>high steps, and got out my purse under a long, straight
rod of gray light.</p>

<p>There were only a few francs left, but I would have
beggared myself to buy this adventure, and thought it
cheap at the price she named. I found a two-franc
piece&mdash;a bright new one, worthy of its destiny&mdash;and
looking up as I shut my purse, I saw the old woman's eyes
fixed on me, and sharp as gimlets. Used to the
dusk now, I could see her dark face distinctly, and so
like a hungry crow did she look that I was startled.
But it was only for a second that I felt a little uncomfortable.
She was so old and weak, I was so young and
strong, that even if she were an evil creature who wanted
to do me harm, I could shake her off and run away as
easily as a bird could escape from a tied cat.</p>

<p>"Make a cross with the silver piece on my palm," she said.</p>

<p>I did as she told me, and it was a dark and dirty palm,
in the hollow of which seemed to lie a tiny pool of shadow.
Her eyes darted to the bracelet-watch as my wrist slipped
out of the protecting sleeve, and I drew back my hand
quickly. She plucked the coin from my fingers, and
then told me to give her my left hand.</p>

<p>"You can't see the lines," I said. "It's too dark."</p>

<p>"I see with my night eyes," she answered, as a witch
might have answered. "And I feel. I have the quick
touch of the blind. I can feel the pores in a flower-petal."</p>

<p>Impressed, I let her hold my hand in one of her lean
claws while she lightly passed the spread fingers of the
other down the length of mine from the tips to the joining
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>with the palm, and then along the palm itself, up and
down and across. It was like having a feather drawn
over my hand.</p>

<p>"You have foreign blood in your veins," she said.
"You are not all French. But you have the charm of
the Latin girl. You can make men love you. You make
them love you whether you wish or not, and whether <i>they</i>
wish or not. Sometimes that is a great trouble to you.
You are anxious now, for many reasons. One of the
reasons is a man, but there is more than one who loves
you. You make one of them unhappy, and yourself
unhappy, too. The man you ought to love is young and
handsome, and dark&mdash;very dark. Do not think ever
of marrying a fair man. You are on a journey now.
Something very unexpected will happen to you at the
end&mdash;something to do with a man, and something to do
with a woman. Be careful then, for your future happiness
may depend on your actions in a moment of surprise.
You are not rich, but you have a lucky hand.
You could find things hidden if you set yourself to look
for them."</p>

<p>"Hidden treasure?" I asked, laughingly, and venturing
to break in because she was speaking slowly now, as if
she had come to the end of her string of prophecies.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Yes. If you looked for the hidden treasure
here, you might be the one to find it after all these
hundreds of years. Who knows? These things happen
to the lucky ones."</p>

<p>"Well, if I believed that I'd been born for such luck,
I'd try to come back some day, and have a look," I said.
"I should begin in this house, I think."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>"It is never so lucky to return for things as to try and
get them at the right time," the old woman pronounced.
"If you would like to wait till my sons come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't," I said. "I must go now."</p>

<p>"If you would at least do me a favour, for the good
fortune I have told you so cheap," she begged. "I,
who in my day have had as much as two louis from
great ladies who would know their fortune!"</p>

<p>"What is the favour?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is next to nothing. Only to go down to the
foot of the stairs in the cellar below this, and pick up my
rosary, which I dropped, and which I know is lying
there."</p>

<p>"It's too dark," I said. "I couldn't see to find it&mdash;and
you said your sons were coming soon."</p>

<p>"Not soon enough, for when you are gone, and I am
alone, I should like to pray at the time of vespers. And
it is not so dark as you think. Besides, this will be the
test of the fortune I have just told you. If it's true that
you have the lucky hand for finding you will put it on
the rosary in an instant. That will be a sign you can find
anything. Unless you are afraid, mademoiselle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course I'm not afraid," I said, for I always
have been ashamed of my fear of the dark, and have
forced myself to fight against it. "If the rosary is at the
foot of the staircase I'll try and get it for you, but I
won't go any farther."</p>

<p>Her corner was close by the opening where more steps
were cut into the rock. I could see the bottom, I thought,
and started down quickly, because I was in a hurry to
come back and be on my way home&mdash;to the Aigle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>Six, seven steps, and then&mdash;crash! down I came on
my hands and knees.</p>

<p>Oh, how it hurt! And how it made my head ring!
Fireworks went off before my eyes, and I felt stupid,
inclined to lie still. But suddenly the idea flashed into
my brain, like lightning darting among dark clouds,
that the old woman had made me do this thing on purpose.
She had played me a trick&mdash;and if she had, she
must have some bad reason for doing it. Those two
sons of hers! I scrambled up, shocked and jarred by
the fall, my hands and knees smarting as if they were skinned.</p>

<p>"I've fallen down," I cried. "Do you hear?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>I called again. It was as still as a grave up above.
It seemed to me that it could not be so unnaturally, so
inhumanly still, if there were a living, breathing creature
there. I was sure now that the horrible old thing had
known what would happen, had wanted it to happen,
and had gone hobbling away to fetch her wicked gipsy
sons. How she had looked at my poor little purse!
How she had looked at Pamela's watch!</p>

<p>I saw now how it was that I had been so stupid. The
dim light from above had lain on the last step and
made it appear as if the floor were near; but there was
a gap between the stairway and the bottom of the cellar.
The lower steps had been hewn away&mdash;perhaps in a
quest for the ever-elusive treasure. Maybe a crack had
appeared, and people, always searching, had suspected
a secret opening and tried to find it. Anyway, there
was the gap, and there was a rough pile of broken stone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>not far off, which had once been the end of the rocky
stairway. It was lucky that I hadn't struck my forehead
against it in falling&mdash;the only bit of luck which the
fortune-teller had brought me!</p>

<p>As it was, I was not seriously hurt. Perhaps I had
torn my dress, and I should certainly have to buy a new
pair of gloves, whether I could afford them or not; otherwise
I didn't think I should suffer, except for a few
black-and-blue patches. But how was I to get out of this
dark hole? That was the question. I was too hot with
anger against the sly old fox of a woman, who had pretended
that she wanted to say her prayers, to feel the
chill of fear; but I couldn't help understanding that she
had got me into this trap with the object of annexing my
watch and purse or anything else of value. Perhaps the
gipsy sons would rob me first, and then murder me, rather
than I should live to tell; but if they meant to do that
they would have to come and be at it soon, or I should
be missed and sought.</p>

<p>This last fancy really did turn me cold, and the nice
hot anger which had kept me warm began to ooze out
at my fingers and toes. I thought of my brave new
brother, who would fight ten gipsy men to save me if
he only knew; and then I wanted to cry.</p>

<p>But that would be the silliest thing I could do. Soon
they would begin to look for me (oh, how furious Lady
Turnour would be that I should dare keep her waiting,
and at the fuss about a servant!) and if I screamed at
the top of my voice maybe some one would hear.</p>

<p>I took a long breath, and gave vent to a blood-curdling
shriek which would have made the fortune of an actress
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>on the stage. Odd! I couldn't help thinking of that at
the time. One thinks of queer things at the most inappropriate
moments.</p>

<p>It was a glorious howl, but the rock walls seemed
to catch it as a battledore catches a shuttlecock, and
send it bounding back to me. I knew then that a cry
from those depths would not carry far; and the fear at
my heart gave a sharp, rat-like bite.</p>

<p>If I could scramble up! I thought; and promptly tried.</p>

<p>It looked almost easy; but for me it was impossible.
A very tall woman might have done it, perhaps, but I
have only five foot four in my Frenchiest French heels;
and the broken-off place was higher than my waist. With
good hand-hold I might have dragged myself up,
but the steps above did not come at the right height to
give me leverage; and always, though I tried again and
again, till my cut hands bled, I couldn't climb up. And
how silly it seemed, the whole thing! I was just like a
young fly that had come buzzing and bumbling round an
ugly old spider's web, too foolish to know that it was a
web. And even now how lightly the fly's feet were
entangled! A spring, and I should be out of prison.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Oh, the little more, and how much it is!</p>
<p class="i0">And the little less, and what worlds away!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>The words came and spoke themselves in my ears, as
if they were determined to make me cry.</p>

<p>I was desperately frightened and homesick&mdash;homesick
even for Lady Turnour. I should have felt like
kissing the hem of her dress if I could only have seen
her now&mdash;and I wasn't able to smile when I thought
what a rage she'd be in if I did it. She would have me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>sent off to an insane asylum: but even that would be
much gayer and more homelike than an underground
cellar in the Ghost City of Les Baux.</p>

<p>Dear old Sir Samuel, with his nice red face! I almost
loved him. The car seemed like a long-lost aunt. And
as for the chauffeur, my brother&mdash;I found that I dared
not think of him. As in my imagination I saw his eyes,
his good dark eyes, clear as a brook, and the lines his
brown face took when he thought intently, the tears began
running down my cheeks.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack&mdash;Jack, come and help me!" I called.</p>

<p>That comes of <i>thinking</i> people's Christian names.
They will pop out of your mouth when you least expect
it. But it mattered little enough now, except that the
sound of the name and the echo of it fluttering back to me
made my tears feel boiling hot&mdash;hotter than the
punch which the Turnours must have finished by this time.</p>

<p>"Jack! Jack!" I called again.</p>

<p>Then I heard a stone rattle up above, somewhere, and
a sick horror rushed over me, because of the gipsy men
coming back with their wicked old mother.</p>

<p>It was only a very dark gray in the cellar, to my
unaccustomed eyes, but suddenly it turned black, with
purple edges. I knew then I was going to faint, because
I've done it once or twice before, and things always began
by being black with purple edges.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p>"For heaven's sake, wake up&mdash;tell me you're not
hurt!" a familiar voice was saying in my ear, or
I was dreaming it. And because it was such a
good dream I was afraid to break it by waking to some
horror, so I kept my eyes shut, hoping and hoping for
it to come again.</p>

<p>In an instant, it did come. "Child&mdash;little girl&mdash;wake
up! Can't you speak to me?"</p>

<p>His hand, holding mine, was warm and extraordinarily
comforting. Suddenly I felt so happy and so perfectly
safe that I was paid for everything. My head was on
somebody's arm, and I knew very well now who the
somebody was. He was real, and not a dream. I sighed
cozily and opened my eyes. His face was quite close to
mine.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he said. "Are you all right?"</p>

<p>"Now you're here," I answered. "I thought they
were coming to kill me."</p>

<p>"Who?" he asked, quite fiercely.</p>

<p>"An old gipsy woman and her sons."</p>

<p>"Those people!" he exclaimed. "Why, it was they
who told me you were in this place. If it hadn't been
for them I shouldn't have found you so soon&mdash;though
I <i>would</i> have found you. The wretches! What made
you think&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>"The old woman was in the room above," I said,
"waiting for her sons; and she begged me to look down
here for a rosary she dropped. She must have known
the bottom steps were gone. She <i>wanted</i> me to fall;
and though I called, she didn't answer, because she'd
probably hobbled off to find her sons and bring them
back to rob me. I haven't hurt myself much, but when
I found I couldn't climb up I was so frightened! I
thought no one would ever come&mdash;except those horrible
gipsies. And when I heard a sound above I was sure
they were here. I felt sick and strange, and I suppose
I must have fainted."</p>

<p>"I heard you call, just as I got into the upper room.
Then, though I answered, everything was still. Jove!
I had some bad minutes! But you're sure you're all
right now?"</p>

<p>"Sure," I answered, sitting up. "Did I call you
'Jack'? If I did, it was only because one can't shriek
'Mister,' and anyway you told me to."</p>

<p>"Now I <i>know</i> you're all right, or you wouldn't bother
about conventionalities. I wish I had some brandy for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't take it if you had."</p>

<p>"That sounds like you. That's encouraging! Are
you strong enough to let me get you up into the light
and air?"</p>

<p>"Quite!" I replied briskly, letting him help me to my
feet. "But how are we to get up?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you. It will be easy."</p>

<p>"Let's look first for the wicked old creature's rosary.
If it isn't here, it's certain she's a fraud."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>"I should think it's certain without looking. I'd like
to put the old serpent in prison."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care to trouble, now I'm safe. And
anyway, how could we prove she meant her sons to rob
me, since they hadn't begun the act, and so couldn't be
caught in it?"</p>

<p>"She didn't know you had a man to look after you.
When the guide and I came this way, searching, we met
a gipsy woman with two awful brutes, and asked if
they'd seen a young lady in a gray coat. They were all
three on their way here, as you thought; but when they
saw us close to this house, of course, they dared not carry
out their plan, and the old woman made the best of a
bad business. No doubt they're as far off by this time
as they could get. It might be difficult to prove anything,
but I'd like to try."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> wouldn't," I said. "But let's look for that rosary.
Have you any matches?"</p>

<p>"Plenty." He took out a match-case, and held a wax
vesta for me to peer about in the neighbourhood of the
broken stairway.</p>

<p>"Here's something glittering!" I exclaimed, just as
I had been about to give up the search in vain. "She
said there was a silver crucifix."</p>

<p>I slipped my fingers into a crack where the rock
had been split in breaking off the lower steps. A
small, bright thing was there, almost buried in d&eacute;bris,
but I could not get my fingers in deep enough to
dislodge it. Impatiently I pulled out a hat-pin, and
worked until I had unearthed&mdash;not the rosary, but a
silver coin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>"Somebody else has been down here, dropping money,"
I said, handing the piece up for Mr. Dane to examine.</p>

<p>"Then it was a long time ago," he replied, "for the
coin has the head of Louis XIII. on it."</p>

<p>"Oh, then she was right!" I cried. "I <i>can</i> find lost
treasure. I'm going to look for more. I believe that
piece must have fallen out of a hole I've found here,
which goes back ever so far into the rock. I can get my
arm in nearly to the elbow."</p>

<p>"<i>Who</i> was 'right'?" my brother wanted to know.</p>

<p>"The gipsy. She told my fortune. That was why I
didn't refuse to look for her rosary."</p>

<p>"I should have thought a child would have known
better," he remarked, scornfully; and his tone hurt my
sensitiveness the more because his voice had been so
anxious and his words so kind when I was fainting. He
had called me "child" and "little girl." I remembered
well, and the words had been saying themselves over
in my mind ever since. I rather thought that they
betrayed a secret&mdash;that perhaps he had been getting to
care for me a little. That idea pleased me, because he
had been abrupt sometimes, and I hadn't known what to
make of him. Every girl owes it to herself to understand
a man thoroughly&mdash;at least, as much of his character
and feelings as may concern her. Besides, it
is not soothing to one's vanity to try&mdash;well, yes, I
may as well confess that!&mdash;to <i>try</i> and please a man,
yet to know you've failed after days of association so
constant and intimate that hours are equal to the
same number of months in an ordinary acquaintance.
Now, after thinking I'd made the discovery that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>really had found me attractive, it was a shock to be
spoken to in this way.</p>

<p>"Oh, you <i>are</i> cross!" I exclaimed, still poking about
in the hole under the stairway.</p>

<p>"I'm not cross," he said, "but if I were, you'd
deserve it, because you know you've been foolish. And
if you don't know, you ought to, so that you may be wiser
next time. The idea of a sensible young woman chumming
up in a lonely cave, with a dirty old gipsy certain
to be a thief, if not worse, letting her tell fortunes, and
then falling into a trap like this. I wouldn't have
believed it of you!"</p>

<p>"I think you're perfectly horrid," said I. "I wish
you had let the guide find me. He would have done it
just as well, and been much more polite."</p>

<p>"Doubtless he would have been more polite, but he
isn't as young, and might have had trouble in getting
you out. There! that's my last match, and you mustn't
waste any more time looking for treasure which you
won't find."</p>

<p>"Which I <i>have</i> found!" I announced. "I've got
something more&mdash;away at the back of the hole. Not
that you deserve to see it!"</p>

<p>However, I held up my hand in its torn, bloodstained
glove, with two silver pieces displayed on the palm.</p>

<p>"A child's hidey-hole, I suppose," he said without
showing as much interest as the occasion warranted.
"Otherwise there would be something more valuable.
A young servant of the Grimaldis, perhaps; these coins
are all of the same period&mdash;of no great value as antiques,
I'm afraid."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>"They're of value to me," I retorted. "They'll bring
me luck." I would of course have given him one, if
he hadn't been so disagreeable; but now I felt that he
shouldn't have anything of mine if he were starving.</p>

<p>"You are very superstitious, among other childlike
qualities," he replied, laughing. So <i>that</i> was what he
thought of me, and <i>that</i> was why he had called me
"child"! It was all spoiled now, from the beginning;
and the guide might as well have found me, as I had
said, without <i>quite</i> meaning it at the time.</p>

<p>"If you don't like lucky things, you can throw away
my St. Christopher," I said, coldly. "You must have
thought it very silly."</p>

<p>"I thought it extremely kind of you to give it, and
I've no intention of throwing it away, or parting with
it," said he. "Now, are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I snapped.</p>

<p>In an instant he had me by the waist between two
hands which felt strong as steel buckles, and swung me
up like a feather on to the first step of the broken stairs.
Then, in another second, he was at my side, supporting
me to the top without a word, except a muttered "Don't
be childish!" when I would have pushed away his arm.</p>

<p>Strange to say, I forgot Lady Turnour and Sir Samuel
until we saw the guide, to whom long ago Mr. Dane had
called up a reassuring <i>"Tout va bien!</i>" Then, suddenly,
the awful truth sprang into my mind. All this time
they had been waiting for me! What would they say?
What would they do?</p>

<p>In my horror, I even forgot my righteous anger with
the chauffeur. "Oh!" I gasped. "<i>The Turnours!</i>"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>Then Mr. Dane spoke kindly again. "Don't worry,"
he said. "It's all right. They've gone on."</p>

<p>"In the car?" I cried.</p>

<p>"No. Sir Samuel can't drive the car. And as
Lady Turnour thought she had a chill, rather than wait
for me to find you they took a carriage which was here,
and drove down to St. Remy. They'll go on by rail to
Avignon, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There must have been a dreadful row!" I groaned.</p>

<p>"Not at all. You're not to worry. Lady Turnour
behaved like a cad, as usual, but what can you expect?
Sir Samuel did the best he could. He would have liked to
wait, but if he'd insisted she would have had hysterics."</p>

<p>"How came there to be a carriage here?" I asked the guide.</p>

<p>"The gentleman paid three young men who had driven
up in it a good sum to get it for himself," he explained,
"and they are walking down. They are of Germany."</p>

<p>"Was it a long time?" I went on. "Oh, it <i>must</i> have
been. It's nearly dark now, except for the moonlight."</p>

<p>"It is perhaps an hour altogether since mademoiselle
separated herself from the others," the guide admitted.
"But they have been gone for more than half that
time. They did not delay long, after the little dispute
with monsieur about the car."</p>

<p>"Oh, there was a dispute!" I caught him up, wheeling
upon the chauffeur. "You <i>must</i> tell me."</p>

<p>"It was nothing much," he said, still very kindly, "and
it was her ladyship's fault, of course. If you were plain
and elderly she'd have more patience; but as it is,
you've seen how quick she is to scold; so, of course, she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>was angry when she'd finished her grog and you
didn't turn up."</p>

<p>"What did she say," I asked.</p>

<p>He laughed. "She was quite irrelevant."</p>

<p>"I must know!"</p>

<p>"Well, she seemed to lay most of the blame on the
colour of your hair and eyelashes."</p>

<p>"She said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What could be expected of a girl that dyed her hair
yellow and her eyelashes black?"</p>

<p>"<i>Horrid</i> woman! You don't believe I do, do you?"</p>

<p>"I must say it hadn't occurred to me to think of it."</p>

<p>Then I remembered how angry I was with him, and
didn't pursue that subject, but turned again to the
other. However, I made a mental note that there was
one more thing to punish him for when I got the chance.</p>

<p>"What else did she say?"</p>

<p>"She began to turn purple when Sir Samuel would
have defended you, and said she wouldn't stand your
taking such liberties. That it was monstrous, and a few
other things, to be kept freezing on mountains by one's
domestics, and that she should be ill if she waited. Sir
Samuel persuaded her to give you fifteen minutes' grace,
but after that she was determined to start. Of course,
she didn't know that an accident had happened. She
thought you were simply dawdling, and wanted Sir
Samuel to arrange for you to drive down with the newly
arrived German tourists. Sir Samuel and I objected to
this, and later it was settled for the Turnours to do what
her ladyship planned for you, without the company of
the tourists. Lady Turnour resents <i>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</i>."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>"It's a miracle she consented to leave the car," I said.</p>

<p>"She couldn't use it without a chauffeur, and naturally
I refused to go without knowing what had happened to you."</p>

<p>"You refused!" I stammered.</p>

<p>"Of course. That was where the row came in. We
had a few words, and eventually I was deputed to look you up."</p>

<p>"Deputed!" I echoed, desperately. "They never
'deputed' you to do it, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"They jolly well couldn't help themselves. You can't
make a man drive a car if he won't. So they went off
in the Germans' carriage, and the Germans were enchanted."</p>

<p>"Oh!" I exclaimed, so miserable now that anger
leaked out of my heart like water through a sieve. "It's
all my fault. Did they discharge you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't give them the chance. After a few little
things her ladyship said, I felt rather hot in the collar,
and discharged myself. That is, I gave them notice that
I would go as soon as they could get another chauffeur.
It would have been bad form to leave them in the lurch,
without anyone, on tour."</p>

<p>The tears came to my eyes, and I was thinking so
little about myself that I let them roll down without
bothering to wipe them away. "Do, do forgive
me," I implored. "But you never can, of course.
All through my foolishness you're out of an engagement.
And you depended upon it, I know, from what you said."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to forgive, my dear little sister,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
he said. "It's you who must forgive me, if I've distressed
you by telling the story in a clumsy way. It wasn't
your fault. I couldn't stand that bounderess's cruel
tongue, so I have myself to blame, if anyone. And it's
sure to turn out right in the end."</p>

<p>"You refused to drive their car because you would
stay behind and find me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Any decent chap would do that&mdash;even a chauffeur."
He spoke lightly to comfort me. "Besides, I wanted
to stop. You're the only sister I ever had."</p>

<p>"You must hate me," I moaned.</p>

<p>"I don't. Please don't cry. I shall faint if you do."</p>

<p>I was obliged to laugh a little through my tears.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, gently. "Let me take you down.
Just a word with the guide about those gipsies, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, leave the wretched gipsies alone!" I begged.
"Who cares, now? If you say anything, they may call
us as witnesses at St. Remy or some town where we
don't want to stop. Let them go."</p>

<p>"I suppose we might as well," he said, "for we can't
prove anything worth proving. Come, then." He
slipped some money into the guide's hand, and thanked
him for his courtesy and kindness. But another pang
shot through my remorseful heart. More money spent
by this man for me, when he had so little, and had lost the
engagement which, though unworthy his rank in life,
was the only present means he had of earning a livelihood.
I came, obeying in forlorn silence, and could
not answer when he tried to cheer me up as we walked
down to the Hotel Monte Carlo. There stood the
Aigle in charge of a youth from the inn, and there was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>more money to be paid to him. I wanted to give it, but
saw that if I insisted Mr. Dane would be vexed.</p>

<p>He suggested putting me inside, as the air was now
very cold, with the chill that falls after sunset; but I
refused. "I want to sit by you!" I implored, and he
said no more. With the glass cage behind us empty,
and the great acetylene lamps alight, the Aigle turned and
flew down the hill.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p>For some time we did not speak, but my thoughts
moved more quickly than the beating of the
engine. At last I said meekly, "Of course, I
may as well consider myself discharged, too. And even
if I weren't, I should go."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about that," Mr. Dane answered.
"It was the first thought that came into my head when
the row began. It isn't likely she'll want you to leave,
because she won't like getting on without a maid. I
think, in the circumstances, unless she is brutal, you'd
better stay with her till your friends can receive you.
Someone <i>must</i> come forward and help you now."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't ask anyone but Pamela, who's gone to
America," I protested. "Besides, I can't stand Lady
Turnour after what's happened&mdash;with you gone."</p>

<p>(As I said this, I remembered again how I had dreaded
to associate with the chauffeur, and planned to avoid him.
It was rather funny, as it had turned out; but somehow
I didn't feel like laughing.)</p>

<p>"Of course <i>you</i> won't mind," I went on. "It's
different for a man. If you were left and I going, it
wouldn't matter, because you'd have the car. But
I've nothing&mdash;except Lady Turnour's 'transformation.'
Luckily, she won't want me to stop."</p>

<p>"I think she will," he said, "because your only fault
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>was in having an accident. You weren't impudent, as
she thinks I was in refusing to drive the car. Also in
letting her see that I thought her willingness to leave a
young girl in a place like this, alone for hours (she did
propose to let me drive back for you) was the most brutal
thing I'd ever heard of."</p>

<p>"Oh, how good you were, to sacrifice yourself like that
for me!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It wasn't entirely for you," he said. "One owes
some things to oneself. But when we get to Avignon,
and it's settled between you and Lady Turnour, promise
to let me know what you mean to do and give me a chance
to advise you."</p>

<p>I promised. But I was so melancholy as to the future
and so ashamed of myself for the trouble brought upon
my only friend, that his efforts to cheer me were hopeless
as an attempt to let off wet fireworks. Mine were soaked;
and instead of admiring the moonlight, which soon flooded
the wild landscape, it made me the more dismal.</p>

<p>The drive by day had seemed short, but now it was
long, for I was in haste to begin the expected battle.</p>

<p>"Courage! and be wise," said Mr. Dane, as he helped
me out of the car in front of the Hotel de l'Europe. "I
shall bring up your dinner again&mdash;it's no use saying
you don't want anything&mdash;and we'll exchange news."</p>

<p>When lions have to be faced, my theory is that the
best thing is to open the cage door and walk in
boldly, not crawl in on your knees, saying: "Please
don't eat me."</p>

<p>I expected Lady Turnour to have a fine appetite for
any martyrs lying about loose, but to my surprise a faint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
"Come in!" answered my dauntless knock, and I beheld
her prostrate in bed.</p>

<p>She said that I had nearly killed her, and that she
would probably not be able to move for a week; but the
story of my adventures with the gipsy interested her somewhat,
and she brightened when she heard of the old coins
found in a hole in the rock. There was not a word about
sending me away, and I suspected that a scene with Sir
Samuel had crushed the lady. Even a worm will turn,
and Sir Samuel may be one of those mild men who, when
once roused, are capable of surprising those who know
them best. Quite meekly she desired that I would show
her the coins, and having seen them, she said that she
would buy them off me. Not that they were of any intrinsic
value, but they might be "lucky," and she would
give me a sovereign for the three.</p>

<p>Then an idea came and whispered in my ear. I thanked
Lady Turnour politely, but said I thought I had better
keep the coins and show them to an antiquary. They
might be more valuable than we supposed, and I should
need all the money, as well as all the luck possible, now
that I was leaving her ladyship's service.</p>

<p>"Leaving!" she echoed. "But as you had an accident
I've made up my mind to excuse you this time,
and not discharge you as I intended. You don't
know your business too well, but any maid is better
than no maid on a tour like this, as Sir Samuel pointed
out to me."</p>

<p>"But, begging your ladyship's pardon," I ventured,
"I understand that the chauffeur is to go because he
stopped at Les Baux to look for me. As he very likely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>saved my life, I couldn't be so ungrateful as to stay on
in my situation when he is losing his for my sake."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" snapped her ladyship. "As if that
had anything to do with you, and if it has, it <i>oughtn't</i>.
Besides, if he will apologize, he can stop. Sir Samuel
says so."</p>

<p>"He doesn't seem to think he was in the wrong, my
lady," said I. "As your ladyship will probably be at
Avignon some time before finding another chauffeur,
it will be easy to look for a maid at the same time."</p>

<p>"Be here some time!" she cried. "I won't! We want
to get on to a ch&acirc;teau where my stepson's visiting."</p>

<p>"I should be delighted to offer your ladyship two of
the lucky coins for nothing," said I, my impertinence
wrapped in honey, "if she would persuade Sir Samuel to
<i>ask</i> the chauffeur to stay."</p>

<p>"Why, that's just what Sir Samuel wants to do, if
I would hear of it!" The words popped out before she
had stopped to think.</p>

<p>"It might be too late after this evening," I suggested.
"The chauffeur will perhaps take steps at once to secure
some other engagement; and I fear that a good man is
always in great demand. I hope that your ladyship will
kindly understand that it would be nothing to <i>me</i>, if he
hadn't got into trouble for my sake."</p>

<p>"You can leave the coins, and call Sir Samuel, who is
in his room next door," remarked Lady Turnour with
dignity. "I will talk with him."</p>

<p>The greedy creature was delighted to have the coins
without paying for them, and delighted with the excuse
to do what she would have liked to do without an excuse,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>if obstinacy had not forbidden. I kept one coin for my
own luck; I called Sir Samuel, who was sulking in his
den, was dismissed with an order for her ladyship's dinner,
which she would have in bed, and told to return with
the menu.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, coming back, I met Mr. Jack
Dane in the corridor.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Sir Samuel yet?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"No. He's sent for me, and I'm on my way to him now."</p>

<p>"He's going to ask you to stay," I said.</p>

<p>"I think you're mistaken there," replied the chauffeur.
"The old boy himself has a strong sense of justice, and
would like to make everything all right, no doubt, but
his wife would give him no peace if he did."</p>

<p>"If he does, though, what shall you do?" I inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>Mr. Dane looked into space. "I think I'd better go in any case."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>If he'd been a woman, I think he would have answered
"Because," but being a man he reflected a few
seconds, and said he thought it would be better for him
in the end.</p>

<p>"Do you want to go?" I asked, drearily.</p>

<p>"No. But I ought to want to."</p>

<p>"Please stay," I begged. "Please&mdash;brother."</p>

<p>"Sir Samuel mayn't ask me; and you wouldn't have
me crawl to him?"</p>

<p>"But if he does ask you."</p>

<p>"I'll stay," he said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>Impulsively, I held out my hand. He took it, and
pressed it so hard that it hurt, then dropped it suddenly.
His manner is certainly very odd sometimes. I suppose
he doesn't want me to flatter myself that I am of any
importance in his scheme of existence. But he needn't
worry. He has shown me very plainly that he is one of
those typical, unsusceptible Englishmen French writers
put in their books, men with hearts whose every
compartment is warranted love-tight.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p>Lady Turnour opened her heart and her wardrobe
and gave me a blouse the first thing in the
morning, which act of generosity was the more
remarkable as morning is not her best time. I have found
that it is the early maid who catches the first snub, which
otherwise might fall innocuously upon a husband. The
blouse was one which I had heard her ladyship say she
hated; but then her idea of true charity, combined, as
it should be, with economy, is always to give to the poor
what you wouldn't be found dead in yourself, because it
is more blessed to give than to receive badly made things.
On the same principle I immediately passed the gift on
to a chambermaid of the hotel, who perhaps in her turn
dropped it a grade lower in the social scale, and so it
may go on forever, blouse without end; but all that is
apart from the point. The important part of the transaction
was the token that the dead past was to bury its
dead; and possibly Sir Samuel timidly offered a waistcoat
or a pair of boots to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>Instead of lying in bed, as Lady Turnour had threatened
to do for a week, she was up earlier than usual,
as well as ever she had been, and not more than half
as disagreeable. Although the sky looked as if it
might burst into tears at any moment, and although
Orange has nothing but historic remains and historic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>records to show, she was ready to start, almost cheerfully,
at ten o'clock.</p>

<p>I was allowed to be of the party, laden with mackintoshes
for my master and mistress; and I didn't admire
the triumphal arch at Orange nearly as much as I had
admired the smaller and older one at St. Remy. But
Lady Turnour admired it far more, and was so nice to Sir
Samuel that he thought it <i>the</i> arch of the world. They
put their heads together over the same volume of Baedeker,
which was an exquisite pleasure to the poor man, and
he was so pathetic I could have cried into his footsteps,
as he read (pronouncing almost everything wrong) about
the building of the Arch of Tiberius. "Why, that's
just like a sweet little statuette I used to have standing
on a table in my drawing-room window!" exclaimed
Lady Turnour, looking up at the beautiful Winged Victory.
"You might think it was a copy!"</p>

<p>Although the histories say Orange wasn't very important
in Roman days, it has taken revenge by letting
everything not Roman fall into decay, except, of course,
its memories of the family through which William the
Silent of Holland became William of Orange. The house
of the first William of Orange, the hero of song who rode
back wounded from Roncesvalles to his waiting wife,
is gone now, save for a wall and a buttress or two on a
lonely hill of the old town; yet the arch, which was old
when his ch&acirc;teau was begun, still towers dark yellow as
tarnished Etruscan gold against the sky; and the Roman
theatre is the grandest out of Italy. Lady Turnour
could not see why the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise should produce
plays there, even once a year, when they could do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>it so much more comfortably at any modern theatre in
the provinces if they <i>must</i> travel; and as to the gathering
of the Felibres, she didn't even know what Felibres were,
nor did she care, as she was unlikely to meet any in
society. She would have proposed going on somewhere
else, as there was so "little to see in Orange," but
that rain came sweeping down, cold from the east, when
I had followed the pair a quarter of a mile from the motor.
They fled into their mackintoshes as a hermit-crab flees
into his borrowed shell, and I was the only one the
worse for wear when we reached the car. I didn't
much mind the wetting, but it was rather nice to be
fussed over by a brother, and forced into a coat of his,
whether I liked or not. "The quality" must have seen
me in it, through the glass, but Lady Turnour ignored
the sight. Altogether, everything was agreeable, and
the thunder-storm of last night, in clearing, had turned us
into quite a happy family party.</p>

<p>It rained all day, and I sat in my room before a blazing
fire of olive wood which a dear old waiter, exactly like
a confidential servant of a pope, bestowed upon me out
of sheer Proven&ccedil;al good nature. As he's been in the
hotel for thirty years, he is a privileged person, and can
do what he likes.</p>

<p>Lady Turnour gave me a pile of stockings to look
over, lest Satan should find some more ornamental
use for my idle hands; so I asked Mr. Dane for his socks
too; and pretended that I should consider it a slight upon
my skill if he refused.</p>

<p>That was our last night at Avignon, and early in the
morning I packed for Arles, where we would sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
But on the way we stopped at Tarascon, so splendid with
its memories of Du Guesclin, and the towers of King
Ren&eacute;'s great ch&acirc;teau reflected in a water-mirror, that
no Tartarin could be blamed if he were born with a
boasting spirit. And there are other things in Tarascon
for its Tartarins to be proud of, besides the noble old
castle where King Ren&eacute; used to spend his springs and
summers when he was tired of living in state at Aix.
There is the church of Saint Martha, and the beautiful
Hotel de Ville, and&mdash;almost best of all for its quaintness,
though far from beautiful&mdash;the great Tarasque lurking
in a dark and secret lair.</p>

<p>We couldn't go into the ch&acirc;teau, but perhaps it was
better to see it only from the outside, and remember it
always in a crystal picture, framed with the turquoise of
the sky. Besides, not going in gave us more time for
Beaucaire, just across the river&mdash;Beaucaire of the Fair;
Beaucaire of sweet Nicolete and her faithful lover Aucassin.</p>

<p>I know a song about Nicolete of the white feet and
hair of yellow gold, and I sang it below my breath, sitting
beside my brother Jack, as we crossed the bridge.
Although I sang so softly, he heard, and turned to me for
an instant. "You <i>can</i> sing!" he said.</p>

<p>"You don't like singing," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Only better than most things&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"Yet you didn't want me to sing the other night."</p>

<p>"That was because your hair was down. I couldn't
stand both together."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Don't you? All the better. Never mind trying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>to guess. Let's think about the fair. Wouldn't you
have liked to come here in the days when it was one
of the greatest shows in all France?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't have come in a motor then."</p>

<p>"You're getting to be an enthusiast. You'll have to
marry a millionaire with at least a forty-horse-power car."</p>

<p>"I happen to be running away from one now, in a
sixty-horse-power car. But I don't want to think of him
in this romantic country. The idea of Corn Plasters,
near the garden where Nicolete's little feet tripped among
the daisies by moonlight, is too appalling."</p>

<p>"Up on the hill are the towers of the castle where
Aucassin was in prison for his love of Nicolete," said
the chauffeur. "If only I can induce them to go there,
and walk in the garden on the battlements! It's beautiful,
full of great perfumed Proven&ccedil;al roses, and quantities
of fleur-de-lys growing wild under pine trees and peering
out of formal yew hedges. You never saw anything
quite like it. Oh, I must manage the thing somehow."</p>

<p>"I think you could, in their present mood," said I.
"They're quite properly honey-moony since the storm,
which was a blessing in disguise. They'll go up, and
feel romantic and young; but as for me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll go up, and <i>be</i> the things they can only feel.
I should like to go with you there&mdash;" he broke off,
looking wistful.</p>

<p>"Oh, do get some one to guard the car, and come,"
I begged him. "You've seen it all before?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You look as if the place had sentimental memories for you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>He smiled. "There is a sentiment attaching to it.
Someday I may tell you&mdash;" he stopped again. "No,
I don't think I'll do that."</p>

<p>Suddenly the thought of the garden was spoiled for
me. I imagined that, in happier days, he must have
walked there with a girl he loved. Perhaps he loved her
still, only misfortune had come to him, and they could not
marry. In that case, I'd been misjudging him, maybe.
His bluntnesses and abruptnesses and coldnesses didn't
mean that the compartments were "love-tight," as I'd
fancied, but that they were already full to overflowing.</p>

<p>He did induce the Turnours to see the garden on the
old battlements, and he did find a suitable watch-dog for
the car in order to be my companion. And he was less
self-conscious and happier in his manner than he had
been since the first day or two of our acquaintance.
Also the garden, starred with spring flowers, was even
more lovely than I had expected. I ought to have enjoyed
every moment there; but&mdash;it is never pleasant to be
with a man when you think he is wishing that you were
another girl.</p>

<p>"Was she pretty?" I couldn't resist asking.</p>

<p>For an instant he looked bewildered; then he understood.
"Very," he replied, smiling. "About the prettiest
girl I ever saw. The description of Nicolete would
fit her very well. 'The clear face, delicately fine,' and
all that. But I don't let my mind dwell much on girls
in these days, when I can help it, as you can well imagine."</p>

<p>"And when you can't help it?" I wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Oh, when I can't help it, I feel like a bear with a
sore head, and no honey in my hollow tree."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>So that is why he is so disagreeable, sometimes! He
is thinking of the girl of the battlemented garden at
Beaucaire. I shall try and find out all about her; but
I don't know that I shall feel better satisfied when I have.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p>The garden on the battlements at Beaucaire
seemed to bring out all that's best in Lady
Turnour, and she was&mdash;for her&mdash;quite
radiant when we arrived at Arles. Not that it was
much credit to her to be radiant, when the road
had been perfect, and the car had behaved like an
angel, as usual; but small favours from small natures
are thankfully received; and just as it is a blight
upon the spirits of the whole party when her ladyship
frowns, so do we cheer up and hope for better things
when she smiles.</p>

<p>As we were to spend the night at Arles, and arrived at
the quaint, delightful H&ocirc;tel du Forum before lunch, even
the working classes (meaning my alleged brother and
myself) could afford that pleasant, leisured feeling which
is the right of those more highly placed.</p>

<p>The moment we arrived I knew that I was going to
fall in love with Arles, and I hurried to get the unpacking
done, so that I might be free to make its acquaintance.
Lady Turnour, still in her garden mood, told me to
do as I liked till time to dress her for dinner, but to mind
and have no more accidents, as all her frocks hooked at the back.</p>

<p>I am getting to be quite a skilled lady's-maid now,
and am not sure it ought not to be my permanent <i>m&eacute;tier</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>though I do like to think I was born for better things,
and comfort myself by remembering how mother used
to say that a lady can always do everything better than a
common person if she chooses to try, even menial work,
because she puts her intelligence and love for daintiness
into all she does. I unpacked my master's and mistress's
things with the flashing speed of summer lightning and
the neatness of a drill-sergeant. In a twinkling everything
was in exactly the right place, and my conscience
felt as if it were growing wings as I flew off to my luncheon.
The whole afternoon free, and the saints only knew what
nice, unexpected adventures might happen! Cousin
Catherine used to say, not meaning to be complimentary,
that I "attracted adventures as some people seem to attract
microbes," and I could almost hear them buzzing round
my head as I ran down-stairs.</p>

<p>There, waiting for me as if he were an incarnate adventure,
was the chauffeur, who appeared to be quite excited.
"You must have a peep into the dining-room," he said.
"The door's open. You can look in without being
noticed, and see the walls, which are painted with pictures
from Mistral's works. Also there's something else of
interest, but I won't tell you what it is. I want to see if
you can discover it for yourself."</p>

<p>I peeped, and found the pictures charming. After
following them with my eyes all round the green walls
which they decorate effectively, my gaze lit upon a man
sitting at one of the small tables. He was with two or
three friends who hung upon the words which he accompanied
by the most graceful, spirited, yet unconscious
gestures. Old he may have been as years go, but the fire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>of eternal youth was in his vivid dark eyes, and his
smile, which had in it the tenderness of great experience,
of long years lived in sympathy and love for mankind.
His head was very noble; and its shape, and the way he
had of carrying it, would alone have shown that he was Someone.</p>

<p>"Who is that man?" I whispered to Jack Dane.
"That one who is so different from all the others."</p>

<p>"Can't you guess?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not Mistral?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It's one of his days here. He'll be in the
museum after lunch. I'll take you there, and if he sees
that you're interested in things, he'll talk to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, how glorious!" I breathed, quite awed at the
prospect. "But if he should find out that we're only
lady's-maid and chauffeur?"</p>

<p>"Do you think it would matter to him <i>who</i> we
were&mdash;a great genius like that? He wouldn't care
if we were beggars, if we had souls and brains and hearts."</p>

<p>"Well, we have got <i>some</i> of those things," I said.
"Do let's hurry, and get to the museum before our
betters. They can always be counted upon to spend
an hour and a half at lunch if there's a good excuse,
such as there's sure to be in this place, famous for rich
Proven&ccedil;al cooking. Whereas Monsieur Mistral looks
as if he would grudge more than half an hour on an
occupation so prosaic as eating."</p>

<p>"Nothing could be prosaic to him," said Mr. Dane.
"And that's the secret of life, isn't it? I think you have
it, too, and I'm trying to take daily lessons from you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
By the time we part I hope I shan't be quite such a
sulky, discontented brute as I am now."</p>

<p>"By the time we part!" The words gave me a queer,
horrid little prick, with just that nasty ache that comes
when you jab a hatpin into your head instead of into your
hat, and have got to pull it out again. I have grown so
used to being constantly with him, and having him look
after me and order me about in his dictatorial but curiously
nice way, that I suppose I shall rather miss him for a
week or two when this odd association of ours comes to an end.</p>

<p>It is strange how one ancient town can differ utterly
from its neighbour, and what an extraordinary, unforgettable
individuality each can have.</p>

<p>The whole effect of Avignon is medi&aelig;val. In Arles
your mind flies back at once to Rome, and then pushes
away from Rome to find Greece. All among the red,
pink, and yellow houses, huddled picturesquely together
round the great arena, you see Rome in the carved
columns and dark piles of brick built into medi&aelig;val walls.
The glow and colour of the shops and houses seem only
to intensify the grimness and grayness of that Roman
background, the immense wall of the arena. Greece
you see in the eyes of the beautiful, stately women, young
and old, in their classic features, and the moulding of
their noble figures. (No wonder Epistemon urged his
giant to let the beautiful girls of Arles alone!) You feel
Greece, too, in the soft charm of the atmosphere, the
dreamy blue of the sky, and the sunshine, which is not
quite garish golden, not quite pale silver; a special sky
and special sunshine, which seem to belong to Arles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>alone, enclosing the city in a dream of vanished days.
The very gaiety which must have sparkled there for happy
Greek youths and maidens gives a strange, fascinating
sadness to it now, as if one felt the weight of Roman rule
which came and dimmed the sunlight.</p>

<p>It was delightful to walk the streets, to look at
the lovely women in their becoming head-dresses, and
to stare into the windows of curiosity shops. But there
was the danger of committing <i>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</i> by running into
the arms of the bride and groom at the museum, so "my
brother" hurried me along faster than I liked, until the
fascination of the museum had enthralled me; then I
thanked him, for Mistral was there, for the moment all alone.</p>

<p>Mr. Dane hadn't told me that they had met before,
but Monsieur Mistral greeted him at once as an acquaintance,
smiling one of his illuminating smiles. He even
remembered certain treasures of the museum which the
chauffeur&mdash;in unchauffeur days&mdash;had liked best.
These were pointed out and their interest explained to
me, best of all to my romantic, Latin side being
the "Cabelladuro d'Or," the lovely golden hair of the
dead Beauty of Les Baux, that enchanted princess whose
magic sleep was so rudely broken. We all talked together
of the exquisite Venus of Arles, agreeing that it was
wicked to have transplanted her to the Louvre; and
Mistral's eyes rested upon me with something like interest
for a moment as I said that I had seen and loved her
there. I felt flattered and happy, forgetting that I was
only a servant, who ought scarcely to have dared speak
in the presence of this great genius.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>"She seems to understand something of the charm of
Provence, which makes our country different from any
other in the world, does she not?" the poet said at last
to my companion. "She would enjoy an August f&ecirc;te at
Arles. Some day you ought to bring her."</p>

<p>Mr. Dane did not answer or look at me; and I was
thankful for that, because I was being silly enough to
blush. It was too easy so see what Monsieur Mistral thought!</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me you knew him already?"
I asked, when we had reluctantly left the museum (which
might be invaded by the Philistines at any minute) and
were on our way to the famous Church of St. Trophime.
That we meant to see first, saving the theatre for sunset.</p>

<p>"Oh," answered the chauffeur evasively, "I wasn't
at all sure he'd remember me. He has so many admirers,
and sees so many people."</p>

<p>"I have a sort of idea that your last visit to this part of
the world was paid <i>en prince</i>, all the same!" I was
impertinent enough to say.</p>

<p>He laughed. "Well, it was rather different from this
one, anyhow," he admitted. "A little while ago it made
me pretty sick to compare the past with the present, but
I don't feel like that now."</p>

<p>"Why have you changed?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Partly the influence of your cheerful mind."</p>

<p>"Thank you. And the other part?"</p>

<p>"Another influence, even more powerful."</p>

<p>"I should like to know what it is, so that I might try to
come under it, too, if it's beneficent," that ever-lively
curiosity of mine prompted me to say.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>"I am inclined to think it is not beneficent," he
answered, smiling mysteriously. "Anyhow, I'm not
going to tell you what it is."</p>

<p>"You never do tell me anything about yourself," I
exclaimed crossly, "whereas I've given you my whole
history, almost from the day I cut my first tooth, up to
that when I&mdash;adopted my first brother."</p>

<p>"Or had him thrust upon you," he amended. "You
see, you've nothing to reproach yourself with in your
past, so you can talk of it without bitterness. I can't&mdash;yet.
Only to think of some things makes me feel
venomous, and though I really believe I'm improving
in the sunbath of your example, which I have every day,
the cure isn't complete yet. Until I am able to talk of
a certain person without wanting to sprinkle my conversation
with curses, I mean to be silent. But I owe
it to you that I don't <i>want</i> to curse her any more. A
short time ago it gave me actual pleasure."</p>

<p>So it is to a woman he owes his misfortunes! As Alice
said in Wonderland, it grows "mysteriouser and mysteriouser."
Also it grows more romantic, when one puts two
and two together; and I have always been great at that.
The "sentimental association" of the battlement garden
plus the inspiration to evil language, equal (in my fancy)
one fair, faithless lady, once loved, now hated. I hate
her, too, whatever she did, and I should like to box her
ears. I hope she's <i>quite</i> old, and married, and that she
makes up her complexion, and everything else which
causes men to tire of their first loves sooner or later.
Not that it is anything to me, personally; but one owes
a little loyalty to one's friends.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>The porch and cloisters of St. Trophime's were too
perfectly beautiful to be marred by a mood; but my
brother Jack's mysteriously wicked sweetheart would
keep coming in between me and the wonderful carvings
in the most disturbing way. Some women never know
when they are wanted! But I did my best to make Mr.
Dane forget her by taking an intelligent interest in everything,
especially the things he cared for most, though once,
in an absent-minded instant, I did unfortunately say:
"I don't admire that type of girl," when we were talking
about a sculptured saint; and although he looked surprised
I thought it too complicated to try and explain.</p>

<p>The afternoon light was burnishing the ancient stone
carvings to copper when we left the cloisters of St. Trophime,
took one last look at the porch, and turned toward
the amphitheatre. We were right to have waited, for
the vast circle was golden in the sunset, like a heavy
bracelet, dropped by Atlas one day, when he stretched a
weary arm; and the beautiful fragments of coloured
marbles, which the Greeks loved and Christians destroyed,
were the jewels of that great bracelet. The place was so
pathetically beautiful in the dying day that a soft sadness
pressed upon me like a hand on my forehead, and echoes
of the long-dead past, when Greek Arles was a harbour of
commerce by sea and river, or when it was Roman Arelate,
rich and cruel, rang in my ears as we wandered
through the cells of prisoners, the dens of lions, and the
rooms of gladiators, where the young "men about town"
used to pat their favourites on oiled backs, or make their
bets on ivory tablets.</p>

<p>"If we were here by moonlight, we should see ghosts,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
I said. "Come, let us go before it grows any darker or
sadder. The shadows seem to move. I think there's
a lion crouching in that black corner."</p>

<p>"He won't hurt you, sister Una," said my brother
Jack. "There's one thing you must see here before
I take you home&mdash;back to the hotel, I mean; and that is
the Saracen Tower, as they call it."</p>

<p>So we went into the Saracen Tower, and high up on
the wall I saw the presentment of a hand.</p>

<p>"That is the Hand of Fatima," explained the guide,
who had been following rather than conducting
us, because the chauffeur knew almost as much about
the amphitheatre as he did. "You should touch it,
mademoiselle, for luck. All the young ladies like to do
that here; and the young men also, for that matter."</p>

<p>Instantly my brother lifted me up, so that I might touch
the hand; and then I would not be content unless he
touched it too.</p>

<p>I had dinner in the couriers' room that evening, with
my brother, when I had dressed Lady Turnour for hers.
We were rather late, and had the room to ourselves, for
the crowd which had collected there at luncheon time
had vanished by train or motor. There was a nice old
waiter, who was frankly interested in us, recognizing
perhaps that, as a maid and chauffeur, we were out of
the beaten track. He wanted to know if we had done
any sight-seeing in Arles, and seemed to take it as a
personal compliment that we had.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle touched the Hand of Fatima, of course?"
he asked, letting a trickle of sauce spill out of a sauce-boat
in his friendly eagerness for my answer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>"Oh, yes, I saw to it that she did that," replied Mr.
Dane, with conscious virtue in the achievement.</p>

<p>"It is for luck, isn't it?" I said, to make conversation.</p>

<p>"And more especially for love," came the unexpected answer.</p>

<p>"For love!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"But yes," chuckled the old man. "If a young girl
puts her hand on the Hand of Fatima at Arles, that hand
puts love into hers. Her fate is sealed within the
month, so it is said."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" remarked Mr. Dane, "I never heard
that silly story before." And he went on eating his dinner
with extraordinary nonchalance and an unusual, almost
abnormal, appetite.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p>I shall always feel that I dreamed Aigues Mortes:
that I fell asleep at night&mdash;oh, but fell very far, so
much farther than one usually falls even when one
wakes with the sensation of dropping from a great height,
that I went bumping down, down from century to century,
until I touched earth in a strange, drear land, to find I
had gone back in time about seven hundred years.</p>

<p>Not that there is a conspicuous amount either of land
or earth at Aigues Mortes, City of Dead Waters&mdash;if
the place really does exist, which I begin to doubt already;
but I have only to shut my eyes to call it up; and in my
memory I shall often use it as a background for some
medi&aelig;val picture painted with my mind. For with my
mind I can rival Raphael. It is only when I try to
execute my fancies that I fail, and then they "all come
different," which is heart breaking. But it will be something
to have the background always ready.</p>

<p>The dream did not begin while we spun gaily from
Arles to Aigues Mortes, through pleasant if sometimes
puerile-seeming country (puerile only because we hadn't
its history dropping from our fingers' ends); but there
was time, between coming in sight of the huge, gray-brown
towers and driving in through the fortified gateway,
for me to take that great leap from the present far
down into the past.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>To my own surprise, I didn't want to think of the
motor-car. It had brought us to older places, but within
this walled quadrangle it was as if we had come full tilt into
a picture; and the automobile was not an artistic touch.
Ingrate that I was, I turned my back upon the Aigle, and
was thankful when Sir Samuel and Lady Turnour walked
out of my sight around the corner of the picture. I pretended,
when they had disappeared, that I had painted
them out, and that they would cease to exist unless I
relented and painted them in again, as eventually I should
have to do. But I had no wish to paint the driver of the
car out of my picture, for in spite of his chauffeur's dress
he is of a type which suits any century, any country&mdash;that
clear-cut, slightly stern, aquiline type which you find
alike on Roman coins and in modern drawing-rooms. He
would have done very well for one of St. Louis's crusaders,
waiting here at Aigues Mortes to sail for Palestine with
his king, from the sole harbour the monarch could claim
as his on all the Mediterranean coast. I decided to let
him remain in the dream picture, therefore, and told
him so, which seemed to please him, for his eyes lighted
up. He always understands exactly what I mean when
I say odd things. I should never have felt <i>quite</i> the same
to him again, I think, if he had stared and asked "What
dream picture?"</p>

<p>I had been brought on this expedition strictly for use,
not for ornament. We were going from Aigues Mortes
to St. Gilles and from St. Gilles to N&icirc;mes, therefore Arles
was already a landmark in our past. I could walk
about and amuse myself if I liked, but I must be at the
inn before the return of my master and mistress to arrange
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>a light repast collected at Arles, as we should have to
lunch later at N&icirc;mes, and the resources of Aigues Mortes
were not supposed to be worthy of millionaires in search
of the picturesque. There were several neat packages,
the contents of which would aid and abet such humble
refreshment as the City of Dead Waters could produce;
but I had more than an hour to play with; and much can
be done in an hour by an enthusiast with a good
circulation.</p>

<p>I had not quite realized, however, how largely my
brother's companionship contributed to my pleasure on
these excursions. We had seen almost everything together,
and suddenly it occurred to me that I was taking his presence
too much for granted. He would not go with me
now, because in so small a round we were certain to
run up against the Turnours, and her ladyship might
be pleased to give me another lecture like that of evil
memory at Avignon. I would have risked future punishment
for the sake of present pleasure, and it was on my
tongue to say so; but I swallowed the words with difficulty,
like an over-large pill.</p>

<p>So it fell out that I wandered off alone, sustaining myself
on high thoughts of Crusaders as I gazed up at the statue
of St. Louis, and paced the sentinels' pathway round the
gigantic ramparts, unchanged since Boccanegra built
them. Looking down from the ramparts the town,
enclosed in the fortress walls, was like a faded chessboard
cast ashore from the wreck of some ancient ship;
and round the dark walls and towers waves of yellow
sand and wastes of dead blue waters stretched as far as
my gaze could reach, toward the tideless sea.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>Louis bought this tangled desert of sand and water
in the middle of the thirteenth century from an Abbot of
Psalmodi, so the guide told me, and I liked the name of
that abbot so much that I kept saying it over and over,
to myself. Abbot of Psalmodi! It was to the ear what
an old, illuminated missal is to the eye, rich with crimson
lake, and gold, and ultramarine. It was as if I heard an
echo from King Arthur's day, that dim, mysterious day
when history was flushed with dawn; the Abbot of Psalmodi!</p>

<p>The heart of Aigues Mortes for me was the great tower
of Constance, but a very wicked heart, full of clever and
murderous devices, which was at its wickedest, not in
the dark ages, but in the glittering times of Louis XIV. and
of other Louis after him. That tower is the bad part
of the dream where horrors accumulate and you struggle
to cry out, while a spell holds you silent. In the days
when Aigues Mortes was not a dream, but a terrible
reality to the prisoners of that cruel tower, how many
anguished cries must have broken the spell; cries from
hideous little dungeons like rat-holes, cries from the far
heights of the tower where women and children starved
and were forgotten!</p>

<p>I was almost glad to get away; yet now that I am
away I shall often go back&mdash;in my dream.</p>

<p>Alexander Dumas the elder went from Aigues Mortes
to St. Gilles, driving along the Beaucaire Canal, on that
famous tour of his which took him also to Les Baux;
and we too went from Aigues Mortes to St. Gilles, though
I'm sure the Turnours had no idea that it was a pilgrimage
in famous footprints. Only the humble maid and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>chauffeur had the joy of knowing that. We had both
read Dumas' account of his journey, and we laughed
over the story of the little saint he stole at Les Baux.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant run to St. Gilles, though there was a
shrewish nip in the wind which made me hope that Lady
Turnour's mind was not running ahead to the mountains
and gorges in front of her, not far away by days
or miles now. I wanted her to get tangled up in them
before she had time to think of the cold, and then it would
be too late to turn tail.</p>

<p>I had just begun to call the little town of St. Gilles an
"ugly hole," and wonder what St. Louis saw to love in it,
when, coming out of a squalid, hilly street through which
I had tried to pick my way on foot, alone, suddenly the
fa&ccedil;ade of the wonderful old church burst upon my sight,
a vision of beauty.</p>

<p>No self-respecting motor-car would have condescended
to trust itself in such a street, and as a rabble of small
male St. Gillesites swarmed round the Aigle when she
stopped at the beginning of the ascent, Mr. Dane had to
play guardian angel. "I've been here before," he said,
as usual, for this whole tour seems to be a twice-told tale
for him. A few days ago I should have pitied him aloud
for not being able to blow the dust off his old impressions;
but now, when he speaks of past experiences, I think:
"Oh, I wonder if this is another place associated in his
mind with that <i>horrid</i> woman?" For on mature deliberation
I have definitely niched her among the Horrors in
my mental museum. In front of me walked Sir Samuel
and Lady Turnour, whose very backs cried out their
loathing of St. Gilles; but abruptly the expression of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>their shoulders changed; they had seen the fa&ccedil;ade, and
even they could not help feeling vaguely that it must be
unique in the world, that of its kind nothing could be more
beautiful.</p>

<p>That was before I saw it, for a respectful distance must
be maintained between Those Who Pay and Those Who
Work; but I guessed from the backs that something
extraordinary was about to be revealed. Then it was
revealed, and I would have given a good deal to have
some one to whom I could exclaim "Isn't it glorious!"</p>

<p>Still, I am luckily very good chums with myself, and
it is never too much trouble to think out new adjectives
for my own benefit, or to indicate quaint points of view.
I was soon making the best of my own society in the way
of intelligent companionship, shaking crumbs of half-forgotten
history out of my memory, and finding a dried
currant of fact here and there. In convent days there
was hardly a saint or saintess with whom I hadn't a
bowing acquaintance, and although a good many have
cut me since, I can generally recall something about them,
if necessary, as title worshippers can about the aristocracy.
I thought hard for a minute, and suddenly up rolled a
curtain in my mind, and there in his niche stood St. Gilles.
He was born in Athens, and was a most highly connected
saint, with the blood of Greek kings in his veins, all
of which was eventually spilled like water in the name
of religion. It seemed very suitable that such perfection
of carving and proportion as was shown in steps, towers,
fa&ccedil;ade, and frieze should be dedicated to a Greek saint,
who must have adored and understood true beauty as
few of his brother saints could.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>Mr. Dane had said, just before I started, that there
was a gem of a spiral staircase, called the Vis de St.
Gilles, which I ought to see, and a house, unspoiled since
medi&aelig;val days; but the question of these sights was
settled adversely for me by my master and mistress.
The frieze they did admire, but it sufficed. Their inner
man and woman clamoured for a feast, and the eyes must
be sacrificed.</p>

<p>As for me, I did not count even as a sacrifice, of course,
but I followed them back to the car as I'd followed them
from it, and the car flew toward N&icirc;mes.</p>

<p>Just at first, for a few moments which I hate to confess
to myself now, I was disappointed in N&icirc;mes. The town
looked cold, and modern, and conceited after the melancholy
charm of Arles and the medi&aelig;val aspect of Avignon;
but that was only as we drove to our stately hotel in its
large, dignified square. Afterward&mdash;after the inevitable
lunching and unpacking&mdash;when I started out once again
in the society of my adopted relative, I prayed to be forgiven.</p>

<p>A gale was blowing, but little cared we. A toque or
a picture-hat make all the difference in the world to a
woman's impressions, even of Paradise&mdash;if the wind be
ever more than a lovely zephyr there. Lady Turnour had
insisted on changing her motoring hat for a Gainsborough
confection which would, I was deadly certain, cause
her to loathe N&icirc;mes while memory should last; but the
better part was mine. Toqued and veiled, the mistral
could crack its cheeks if it liked; it couldn't hurt mine,
or do unseemly things to my hair.</p>

<p>In the gardens of Louis XIV. I gave myself to N&icirc;mes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>as devotee forever; and as the glories of the past slowly
dawned upon me, that Past round which the King had
planted his flowers and formal trees, and placed vases and
statues, I wished I were a worthier worshipper at the shrine.</p>

<p>I think that there can be no more beautiful town in
the world than N&icirc;mes in springtime. The wind brought
fairy perfumes, and lovely little green and golden puff-balls
fell from the budding trees at our feet, as if they
wanted to surprise us. The fish in the crystal clear water
of the old Roman baths, which King Louis tried to spoil
but couldn't, swam back and forth in a golden net of sunshine.
We two children of the twentieth century amused
ourselves in attempting to reconstruct the baths as they
must have looked in the first century; and the glimmering
columns under the green water, now lost to the eye, now
seen again, white and elusive as mermaids playing hide
and seek, helped our imagination.</p>

<p>Far easier was it to go back to Rome in the Temple
of Diana, so beautiful in ruin and so little changed except
by time, as to bring to the heart a pang of mingled joy
and pain, of sadness which women love and men resent&mdash;unless
they are poets. Doves were cooing softly there,
the only oracles of the temple in these days; and what
they said to each other and to us seemed more mysterious
than the sayings of common doves, because their ancestors
had no doubt handed down much wisdom to them, from
generation to generation, ever since Diana was taken
seriously as a goddess, or perhaps even since the dim days
when Celtic gods were reigning powers.</p>

<p>From the gardens we went slowly to that other temple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>which unthinking people and guide-books have named
the Maison Carr&eacute;e, the most lovely temple out of Greece,
and the one which has suffered most from sheer, uncompromising
stupidity in modern days. Now it rests from
persecution, though it shows its scars; and I wondered
dully, as I stood gazing at the Corinthian columns&mdash;strong,
yet graceful&mdash;how so dull a copy as the Madeleine
could possibly have been evolved from such perfection.</p>

<p>Inside in the museum was the dearest old gentleman in
a tall hat, who explained to us with ingenuous pride and
dignity the splendid collection of coins which he himself
had given to the town. It was easy to see that they were
the immediate jewels of his soul; there was not one piece
which he did not know and love as if it had been his child,
though there were so many thousands that he alone could
keep strict count of them. He insisted gravely upon the
superlative value of the least significant in appearance,
but he could joke a little about other things than coins.
There was an old mosaic which we admired, with a faded
God of Love riding a winged steed.</p>

<p>"<i>L'Amour s'en va</i>," he chuckled, pointing to the half-obliterated
figure. "<i>N'est pas?</i>" and he turned to me
for confirmation. "I don't know yet," I answered.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle is very fortunate&mdash;but very young,"
said the dear old gentleman, looking like a late eighteenth-century
portrait as he smiled under his high hat. "And
what thinks monsieur?"</p>

<p>"That it is better not to give him a chance to fly away,
by keeping the door shut against him in the beginning,"
replied Mr. Dane, as coldly as if he kept his heart on ice.</p>

<p>Sunset was fading, like Love on the mosaic, when we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>came to the amphitheatre; but the sky was still stained
red, and each great arch of stone framed a separate ruby.
It was a strange effect, almost sinister in its splendour,
and all the air was rose-coloured.</p>

<p>"Is it a good omen or an evil one for our future?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Means storms, I think," the chauffeur answered in the
laconic way he affects sometimes, but there was an odd
smile in his eyes, almost like defiance&mdash;of me, or of Fate.
I didn't know which but I should have liked to know.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>


<p>The wind sang me to sleep that night in N&icirc;mes&mdash;sang
in my dreams, and sang me awake
when morning turned a white searchlight on
my eyelids.</p>

<p>I was glad to see sunshine, for this was the day of our
flight into the north, and if the sky frowned on the enterprise
Lady Turnour might frown too, in spite of Bertie
and his ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>It was cold, and I trembled lest the word "snow"
should be dropped by the bridegroom into the ear of the
bride; but nothing was said of the weather or of any
change in the programme, while I and paint and powder
and copper tresses were doing what Nature had refused
to do for her ladyship.</p>

<p>"Cold morning, madame!" remarked the porter, who
came to bring more wood for the sitting-room fire before
breakfast. He was a polite and pleasant man, but I could
have boxed his ears. "Madame departs to-day in her
automobile? Is it to go south or north? Because in the
north&mdash;"</p>

<p>With great presence of mind I dropped a pile of maps
and guide-books.</p>

<p>"What a clumsy creature you are!" exclaimed her ladyship,
playing into my hands. "I couldn't understand
the last part of what he said."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>Luckily by this time the man was gone; and my memory
of his words was extraordinarily vague. But a dozen
things contrived to keep me in suspense. Every one
who came near Lady Turnour had something to say about
the weather. Then, for the first time, it occurred to the
Aigle to play a trick upon us. Just as the luggage was
piled in, after numerous little delays, she cast a shoe;
in other words, burst a tyre, apparently without any
reason except a mischievous desire to be aggravating.
Another half hour wasted! And fat, silvery clouds were
poking up their great white heads over the horizon in the
north, where, perhaps, they were shaking out powder.</p>

<p>The next thing that happened was a snap and a tinkle
in our inner workings, rather like the sound you might
expect if a giantess dropped a hairpin. "Chain broken!"
grumbled the chauffeur, as he stopped the car on the
level of a long, straight road, and jumped nimbly down.
"We oughtn't to have boasted yesterday."</p>

<p>"Who's superstitious now?" I taunted him, as he
searched the tool-box in the same way a child ransacks
a Christmas stocking.</p>

<p>"Oh, about motor-cars! That's a different thing,"
said he calmly. "Cold, isn't it? My fingers are so
stiff they feel as if they were all thumbs."</p>

<p>"Et tu, Brute," I wailed. "For <i>goodness</i>' sake, don't
let <i>her</i> hear you. She's capable even now of turning
back. The invitation to the ch&acirc;teau hasn't come&mdash;and
we're not safely in the gorges yet."</p>

<p>"Nor shan't be soon, if this sort of thing keeps on,"
remarked the chauffeur. "We shall have to lunch at Alais."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>"You say that as if it was the devil's kitchen."</p>

<p>"There's probably first rate cooking in the devil's
kitchen; I'm not so sure about the inns at Alais."</p>

<p>"But it's arranged to picnic on the road to-day for the
first time, you know. They put up such good things at
N&icirc;mes, and I was to make coffee in the tea-basket."</p>

<p>"That's why I wanted to get on. Picnic country
doesn't begin till after Alais. Who could lunch on a
dull roadside like this? Only a starving tramp wouldn't
get indigestion."</p>

<p>It was true, and I began to detest the unknown Alais.
Perhaps, after all, we might sweep through the place, I
thought, without the idea of lunch occurring to the
passengers. But Mr. Dane's heart-to-heart talk with
the Aigle resulted in quite a lengthy argument; and no
sooner did a town group itself in the distance than Sir
Samuel knocked on the glass behind us.</p>

<p>"What place is this?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Alais," was the answer the chauffeur made with his
lips, while his eyebrows said "I told you so!" to me.</p>

<p>"I think we'd better lunch here," Sir Samuel went
on. And the arrival of a princely blue motor car at the
nearest inn was such a shock to the nerves of the
landlady and her staff that the interval before lunch
was as long and solemn as the Dead March in Saul. To
show what he could do in an emergency, the chef
slaughtered and cooked every animal within reach for
miles around.</p>

<p>They appeared in a procession, according to their kind,
when necessary disguised in rich and succulent sauces
which did credit to the creator's imagination; and there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>were reserve forces of cakes, preserves, and puddings,
all of which coldly furnished forth the servants' meal when
they had served our betters.</p>

<p>It was nearly three o'clock when we were ready to
leave Alais, and the chauffeur had on his bronze-statue
expression as he took his seat beside me after starting
the car.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said he, "except that I don't know where
we're likely to lay our heads to-night."</p>

<p>"Where do you want to lay them?" I inquired
flippantly. "Any gorge will do for mine."</p>

<p>"It won't for Lady Turnour's. But it may have to, and
in that case she will probably snap yours off."</p>

<p>"Cousin Catherine has often told me it was of no use
to me, except to show my hair. But aren't there hotels
in the gorge of the Tarn?"</p>

<p>"There are in summer, but they're not open yet, and
the inns&mdash;well, if Fate casts us into one, Lady Turnour
will have a fit. My idea was: a splendid run through
some of the wildest and most wonderful scenery of France&mdash;little
known to tourists, too&mdash;and then to get out of
the Tarn region before dark. We may do it yet, but if
we have any more trouble&mdash;"</p>

<p>He didn't finish the sentence, because, as if he had
been calling for it, the trouble came. I thought that an
invisible enemy had fired a revolver at us from behind
a tree, but it was only a second tyre, bursting out loud,
instead of in a ladylike whisper, like the other.</p>

<p>Down got Mr. Dane, with the air of a condemned
criminal who wants every one to believe that he is delighted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>to be hanged. Down got I also, to relieve the car of my
weight during the weird process of "jacking up," though
the chauffeur assured me that I didn't matter any more
than a fly on the wheel. Our birds of paradise remained
in their cage, however, Lady Turnour glaring whenever
she caught a glimpse of the chauffeur's head, as if he
had bitten that hole in the tyre. But before us loomed
mountains&mdash;disagreeable-looking mountains&mdash;more like
<i>embonpoints</i> growing out of the earth's surface than
ornamental elevations. On the tops there was something
white, and I preferred having Lady Turnour glare at the
chauffeur, no matter how unjustly, than that her attention
should be caught by that far, silver glitter.</p>

<p>Suddenly my brother paused in his work, unbent his
back, stood up, and regarded his thumb with as much
intentness as if he were an Indian fakir pledged to look
at nothing else for a stated number of years. He pinched
the nail, shook his hand, and then, abandoning it as
an object of interest, was about to inflate the mended
tyre when I came forward.</p>

<p>"You've hurt yourself," I said.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were looking," he replied, fixing
the air-pump. "Your back seemed to be turned."</p>

<p>"A girl who hasn't got eyes in the back of her head is
incomplete. What have you done to your hand?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much. Only picked up a splinter somehow.
I tried to get it out and couldn't. It will do when we
arrive somewhere."</p>

<p>"Let me try," I said.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! A little flower of a thing like you! Why,
you'd faint at the sight of blood."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>"Oh, is it bleeding?" I asked, horrified, and forgetting
to hide my horror.</p>

<p>He laughed. "Only a drop or two. Why, you're
as white as your name, child."</p>

<p>"That's only at the thought," I said. "I don't mind
the <i>sight</i>, although I <i>do</i> think if Providence had made
blood a pale green or a pretty blue it would have been less
startling than bright red. However, it's too late to change
that now. And if you don't show me your thumb, I'll
have hysterics instantly, and perhaps be discharged by
Lady Turnour on the spot."</p>

<p>At this awful threat, which I must have looked terribly
capable of carrying out, he obeyed without a word.</p>

<p>A horrid little, thin slip of iron had gone deep down
between the nail and the flesh, and large drops of the
most sensational crimson were splashing down on to the ground.</p>

<p>"The idea of your driving like that!" I exclaimed
fiercely. But my voice quivered. "One, two, three!"
I said to myself, and then pulled. I wanted to shut my
eyes, but pride forbade, so I kept them as wide open as
if my lids had been propped up with matches. Out
came the splinter of metal, and seeing it in my hand&mdash;so
long, so sharp&mdash;things swam in rainbow colours
for a few seconds; but I was outwardly calm as a Stoic,
and wrapped the thumb in my handkerchief despite my
brother's protests.</p>

<p>"Brave child," he said. "Thank you."</p>

<p>I looked up at him, and his eyes had such a beautiful
expression that a queer tenderness began stirring in my
heart, just as a young bird stirs in a nest when it wakes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>up. I couldn't help having the impression that he felt
the same thing for me at the moment. It was as if our
thoughts rushed together, and then flew away in a hurry,
frightened at something they'd seen. He dashed back
to his tyre pumping, and I pranced away down the road
to look intently at a small white stone, as if it had been a
pearl of price.</p>

<p>Afterward I stooped and picked it up. "You're
a kind of little milestone in my life," I said to it. "I
think I'd like to keep you, I hardly know why." And I
slipped it into the pocket of my coat.</p>

<p>Every sort of work that you do on a motor-car always
seems to take exactly half an hour. You may <i>think</i> it
will be twenty minutes, but you know in your heart that
it will be thirty, to the last second. The people in the
glass-house lost count of time after the first, through playing
some ghastly kind of double dummy bridge, and as they
seemed cheerful Lady Turnour and her dummy were
evidently winning. But Mr. Dane did not lose count,
I was sure; and when we had started again, and got a
mile or two beyond Alais, he looked somewhat sternly
at the mountains which no longer appeared ill-shapen.
We mounted toward them over the heads of their children
the foothills, and came into a region which promised
wild picturesqueness. There was an extra thrill, too,
because the mountains were the C&eacute;vennes, where Robert
Louis Stevenson wandered with his Modestine, and slept
under the stars. Judging from the gravity of the
chauffeur's face he was not sure that we, too, might not
have to sleep under the stars (if any), a far less care-free
company than "R.L.S." and his donkey.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>Sir Samuel has now exchanged cards for a Taride
map, which he often studied with no particular result
beyond mental satisfaction, as he generally held it upside
down and got his information by contraries. But at a
straggling hillside village where two roads bifurcated he
suddenly became excited. Down went the window, and
out popped his head.</p>

<p>"You go to the left here!" he shouted, as the Aigle was
winging gracefully to the right.</p>

<p>"I think you're mistaken, sir," replied the chauffeur,
stopping while the car panted reproachfully. "I know
the 'Routes de France' says left, but they told me at
Alais a new road had now been finished, and the old one
condemned."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd take anything I heard there with a grain of
salt," said Sir Samuel. "How should they know?
Motor-cars are strange animals to them. If there were
a new road the 'Routes' would give it, and <i>I</i> vote for
the left."</p>

<p>"Whose car is it, anyway?" Lady Turnour was heard
to murmur, not having forgiven my Fellow Worm two
burst tyres and a broken chain.</p>

<p>Since chauffeurs should be seen and not heard, Mr.
Jack Dane looked volumes and said not a word. Backing
the big Aigle, who was sulking in her bonnet, he put her
nose to the left. Now we were making straight, almost
as the crow flies, for the Cevennes; but luckily for Lady
Turnour's peace of mind the snowy tops were hidden from
sight behind other mountains' shoulders as we approached.
A warning chill was in the air, like the breath of a ghost;
but it could not find its way through the glass; and a few
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>cartloads of oranges which we passed opportunely looked
warm and attractive, giving a delusive suggestion of the
south to our road.</p>

<p>It was gipsy-land, too, for we met several tramping
families: boldly handsome women, tall, dark men and
boys with eagle eyes, and big silver buttons so well cared
for they must have been precious heirlooms. "'Steal all
you can, and keep your buttons bright,' is a gipsy
father's advice to his son," said Jack Dane, as we wormed
up the road toward a pass where the brown mountains
seemed to open a narrow, mysterious doorway.
So, fold upon fold shut us in, as if we had entered
a vast maze from which we might never find our way
out; and soon there was no trace of man's work anywhere,
except the zigzag lines of road which, as we glanced
up or down, looked like thin, pale brown string tied as
a child ties a "cat's-cradle." We were in the ancient
fastnesses of the Camisards; and this world of dark rock
under clouding sky was so stern, so wildly impressive, that
it seemed a country hewn especially for religious martyrs,
a last stand for such men as fought and died praying,
calling themselves "enfants de Dieu." Bending out
from the front seat of the motor, my gaze plunged far
down into the beds of foaming rivers, or soared far up to
the dazzling white world of snow and steely sky toward
which we steadily forged on. Oh, there was no hope
of hiding the snow now from those whom it might concern!
But Lady Turnour still believed, perhaps, that
we should avoid it.</p>

<p>The higher the Aigle rose, climbing the wonderful road
of snakelike twistings and turnings above sheer precipices,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>the more thrilling was the effect of the savage landscape
upon our souls&mdash;those of us who consciously possess souls.</p>

<p>We had met nobody for a long time now; for, since
leaving the region of pines, we seemed to have passed
beyond the road-mender zone, and the zone of waggons
loaded with dry branches like piled elks' horns. Still, as
one could never be sure what might not be lurking behind
some rocky shoulder, where the road turned like a tight
belt, our musical siren sang at each turn its gay little
mocking notes.</p>

<p>After a lonely mountain village, named St. Germain-en-Calberte,
and famous only because the tyrant-priest
Chayla was burned there, the surface of the road changed
with startling abruptness. Till this moment we'd known
no really bad roads anywhere, and almost all had been as
white as snow, as pink as rose leaves, and smooth as
velvet; but suddenly the Aigle sank up to her expensive
ankles in deep, thick mud.</p>

<p>"Hullo, what's this bumping? Anything wrong with
the car?"</p>

<p>Out popped Sir Samuel's anxious head from its luxurious
cage.</p>

<p>"The trouble is with the road," answered the chauffeur,
without so much as an "I told you so!" expression on his
face. "I'm afraid we've come to that <i>d&eacute;class&eacute;e</i> part."</p>

<p>Poor Sir Samuel looked so humble and sad that I was
sorry for him. "My mistake!" he murmured meekly.
"Had we better turn after all?"</p>

<p>"I fear we can't turn, or even run back, sir," said
Mr. Dane. "The road's so bad and so narrow, it would
be rather risky."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>This was a mild way of putting it; and he was considerate
in not mentioning the precipice which fell abruptly
down under the uneven shelf he generously called a road.</p>

<p>Sir Samuel gave a wary glance down, and said no more.
Luckily Lady Turnour, sitting inside her cage, on the
side of the rock wall we were following up the mountains,
could not see that unpleasant drop under the shelf, or
even quite realize that she was on a shelf at all. Her
husband sat down by her side, more quietly than he had
got up, even forgetting to shut the window; but he was
soon reminded of that duty.</p>

<p>"Are you frightened?" the chauffeur asked me; and I
thought it no harm to answer: "Not when you're driving."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that? Or is it only an empty little
compliment?" he catechized me, though his eyes did
not leave the narrow slippery road, up which he was steering
with a skill of a woman who aims for the eye of a
delicate needle with the end of a thread a size too big.</p>

<p>"I mean it!" I said.</p>

<p>"I'm glad," he answered. "I was going to tell you
not to be nervous, for we shall win through all right with
this powerful car. But now I will save my breath."</p>

<p>"You may," I said, "I'm very happy." And so
I was, though I had the most curious sensation in my toes,
as if they were being done up in curl papers.</p>

<p>On we climbed, creeping along the high shelf which
was so untidily loaded with rough, fallen stones and
layers of mud, powdered with bits of ice from the rocky
wall that seemed sheathed in glass. Icicles dangled
heavy diamond fringes low over the roof of the car; snow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>lay in dark hollows which the sun could never reach even
in summer noons; and as we ploughed obstinately on,
always mounting, the engine trembling, our fat tyres
splashed into a custardy slush of whitish brown. The
shelf had been slippery before; now, slopping over with
this thick mush of melting snow or mud, it was like driving
through gallons of ice pudding. The great Aigle began
to tremble and waltz on the surface that was no surface;
yet it would have been impossible to go back. I saw
by my companion's set face how real was the danger we
were in; I saw, as the car skated first one way, then
another, that there were but a few inches to spare on
either side of the road shelf; the side which was a rocky
wall, the side which was a precipice; I saw, too, how the
man braced himself to this emergency, when three lives
besides his own depended on his nerve and skill, almost
upon his breath&mdash;for it seemed as if a breath too long, a
breath too short, might hurl us down&mdash;down&mdash;I dared
not look or think how far. Yet the fixed look of courage
and self-confidence on his face was inspiring. I trusted
him completely, and I should have been ashamed to
feel fear.</p>

<p>But it was at this moment, when all hung upon the
driver's steadiness of eye and hand, that Lady Turnour
chose to begin emitting squeaks of childish terror. I
hadn't known I was nervous, and only found out that
I was highly strung by the jump I gave at her first shriek
behind me. If the chauffeur had started&mdash;but he
didn't. He showed no sign of having heard.</p>

<p>I would not venture to turn, and look round, lest the
slightest movement of my body so near his arm might
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>disturb him; but poor Sir Samuel, driven to desperation
by his wife's hysterical cries, pushed down the glass again.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, Dane, this is appalling!" he said. "My
wife can't bear it. Isn't it possible for us to&mdash;to&mdash;"
he paused, not knowing how to end so empty a sentence.</p>

<p>"All that's possible to do I'm doing," returned the
chauffeur, still looking straight ahead. And instead
of advising the foolish old bridegroom to shake the bride
or box her ears, as surely he was tempted to do, he
added calmly that her ladyship must not be too anxious.
We were going to get out of this all right, and before long.</p>

<p>"Tell him to go back. I <i>shall</i> go back!" wailed Lady
Turnour.</p>

<p>"Dearest, we can't!" her husband assured her.</p>

<p>"Then tell him to stop and let me get out and walk.
This is too awful. He wants to kill us."</p>

<p>"<i>Can</i> you stop and let us get out?" pleaded Sir Samuel.</p>

<p>"To stop here would be the most dangerous thing we
could do," was the answer.</p>

<p>"You hear, Emmie, my darling."</p>

<p>"I hear. Impudence to dictate to you! Whatever
<i>you</i> are willing to do, <i>I</i> won't be bearded."</p>

<p>One would have thought she was an oyster. But
she was quite right in not wishing to add a beard to her
charms, as already a moustache was like those coming
events that cast a well-defined shadow before. For an
instant I half thought that Mr. Dane would try and stop,
her tone was so furious, but he drove on as steadily as
if he had not a passenger more fit for Bedlam than for a motor-car.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>Seeing that Dane stuck like grim death to his determination
and his steering-wheel, Sir Samuel shut the
window and devoted himself to calming his wife who,
I imagine, threatened to tear open the door and jump
out. The important thing was that he kept her from
doing it, perhaps by bribes of gold and precious stones,
and the Aigle moved on, writhing like a wounded snake
as she obeyed the hand on the wheel. If the slightest
thing should go wrong in the steering-gear, as we read
of in other motor-cars each time we picked up a newspaper&mdash;but
other cars were not in charge of Mr. Jack
Dane. I felt sure, somehow, that nothing would ever
go wrong with a steering-gear of whose destiny he was master.</p>

<p>Not a word did he speak to me, yet I felt that my
silence of tongue and stillness of body was approved of by
him. He had said that we would be "out of this before
long," so I believed we would; but suddenly my eyes
told me that something worse than we had won through
was in store for us ahead.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>


<p>All this time we'd been struggling up hill, but
abruptly we came to the top of the ascent, and had
to go sliding down, along the same shelf, which
now seemed narrower than before. Looking ahead, it
appeared to have been bitten off round the edge here and
there, just at the stiffest zigs and zags of the nightmare
road. And far down the mountain the way went winding
under our eyes, like the loops of a lasso; short, jerky loops,
as we came to each new turn, to which the length of our
chassis forced us to bow and curtsey on our slippery,
sliding skates. Forward the Aigle had to go until her
bonnet hung over the precipice, then to be cautiously
backed for a foot or two, before she could glide ticklishly
down the next steep gradient.</p>

<p>Involuntarily I shrank back against the cushions, bit
my lip, and had to force myself not to catch at the arm
of the seat in those giddy seconds when it felt as if we
were dropping from sky to earth in a leaky balloon;
but if the blood in your veins has been put there by decent
ancestors who trail gloriously in a long line behind you,
I suppose it's easier for you not to be a coward than it
is for people like the Turnours, who have to be their
own ancestors, or buy them at auctions.</p>

<p>The first words my companion spoke to me came as
the valley below us narrowed. "Look there," he said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>nodding; and my gaze followed the indication, to light
joyously upon a distant <i>col</i>, where clustered a friendly
little group of human habitations.</p>

<p>The sight was like a signal to relax muscles, for though
there was a long stretch still of the appalling road
between us and the <i>col</i>, the eye seemed to grasp safety,
and cling to it.</p>

<p>"Beyond that <i>col</i> we shall strike the <i>route nationale</i>,
which we missed by coming this way," said Mr. Dane;
and then it was the motor only which gave voice, until
we were close to the oasis in our long desert of danger.
That comforting voice was like a song of triumph as the
Aigle paused to rest at last before a <i>gendarmerie</i> and a
rough, mountain inn. Some men who had been standing
in front of the buildings gave us a hearty cheer as we drew
up at the door, and grinned a pleasant welcome.</p>

<p>"We have been watching you a long way off," said a
tall gendarme to the chauffeur, "and to tell the truth we
were not happy. That road has been <i>d&eacute;class&eacute;e</i> for some
time now, and is one of the worst in the country, even in
fine weather. It was not a very safe experiment, monsieur;
but we have been saying to each other it was a
fine way to show off your magnificent driving."</p>

<p>Laughing, Jack Dane assured the gendarme that it
was not done with any such object, and Sir Samuel, out
of the car by this time, with the indignant Lady Turnour,
wanted the conversation translated. I obeyed immediately,
and he too praised his chauffeur, in a nice manly
way which made me the more sorry for him because he
had succeeded in marrying his first love.</p>

<p>"I should like to pay you compliments too," said I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>hurriedly, in a low voice, when Sir Samuel and Lady
Turnour had gone to the inn door to revive themselves
with blood-warming cordials after their thrilling
experience. "I should like to, only&mdash;it seems to go
beyond compliments."</p>

<p>"I hate compliments, even when I deserve them, which
I don't now," replied the young man whom I'd been
comparing sentimentally in my mind with the sun-god,
steering his chariot of fire up and down the steeps of
heaven from dawn to sunset. "And I'd hate them above
all from my&mdash;from my little pal."</p>

<p>Nothing he could have named me would have pleased
me as well. During the wild climb, and wilder drop, we
had hardly spoken to each other, yet I felt that I could
never misunderstand him, or try frivolously to aggravate
him again. He was too good for all that, too good to be
played with.</p>

<p>"You are a man&mdash;a real <i>man</i>," I said to myself. I
felt humble compared with him, an insignificant wisp of
a thing, who could never do anything brave or great
in life; and so I was proud to be called his "pal."
When he asked if I, too, didn't need some cordial, I
only laughed, and said I had just had one, the strongest
possible.</p>

<p>"So have I," he answered. "And now we ought to
be going on. Look at those shadows, and it's a good
way yet to Florac, at the entrance of the gorge."</p>

<p>Already night was stretching long gray, skeleton fingers
into the late sunshine, as if to warm them at its glow
before snuffing it out.</p>

<p>It was easier to say we ought to go, however, than to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>induce Lady Turnour to get into the car again, after all
she had endured, and after that "bearding" which evidently
rankled still. She had not forgiven the chauffeur
for the courage which for her was merely obstinacy and
impudence, nor her husband for encouraging him; but
the glow of the cordial in her veins warmed the cockles
of her heart in spite of herself (I should think her heart
was <i>all</i> cockles, if they are as bristly as they sound);
and as it would be dull to stop on this <i>col</i> for the rest
of her life, she at last agreed to encounter further
dangers.</p>

<p>"Come, come, that's my brave little darling!" we
heard Sir Samuel coo to her, and dared not meet each
other's eyes.</p>

<p>The road, from which we ought never to have strayed,
was splendid in engineering and surface, and we winged
down to earth in a flight from the clouds. Ice and snow
were left behind on the heights, and the Aigle gaily careered
down the slopes like a wild thing released from a weary
bondage. As we whirled earthwards, embankments and
railway bridges showed here and there by our side, but we
lost all such traces of feverish modern civilization as we
swept into the dusky hollow at the bottom of which Florac
lay, like a sunken town engulfed by a dark lake.</p>

<p>We did not pause in the curiously picturesque place,
which looked no more than a village, with its gray-brown
houses and gray brown shadows huddled confusedly
together. Probably it looked much the same when the
Camisards used to hide themselves and their gunpowder
in caves near by; and certainly scarce a stone or brick
had been added or removed since Stevenson's eyes saw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>the town, and his pen wrote of it, as he turned away
there from the Tarn region, instead of being the first
Englishman to explore it. And what a wild region it
looked as we and the Aigle were swallowed up in the
yawning mouth of the gorge!</p>

<p>In an every-day world, above and outside, no doubt it
was sunset, as on other evenings which we had known
and might know again; but this hidden, underground
country had no place in an every-day world. It seemed
almost as if my brother and I (I can't count the Turnours,
for they were so unsuitable that they temporarily ceased
to exist for us) were explorers arriving in an air-ship,
unannounced, upon the planet Mars.</p>

<p>The moon, a glinting silver shield, shimmered pale
through ragged red clouds like torn and blood-stained
flags; and the walls of the gorge into which we penetrated,
bleakly glittering here and there where the moon touched
a vein of mica, were the many-windowed castles of the
Martians, who did not yet know that they had visitors
from another world.</p>

<p>There were fantastic villages, too, whose builders and
inhabitants must have drawn their architectural inspiration
from strange mountain forms and groupings, after
the fashion of those small animals who defend themselves
by looking as much as possible like their surroundings.
And if by some mistake we hadn't landed on Mars, we
were in gnome-land, wherever that might be.</p>

<p>There was no ordinary twilight here. The brown-gray
of rocks and wild rock-villages was flushed with red
and shadowed with purple; but as the moon drank up
the ruddy draught of sunset, the landscape crouched
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>and hunched its shoulders into shapes ever more extraordinary.
The white light spilled down from the tilted
crescent like silver rain, and bleached the few pink peach-blossoms,
which bloomed timidly under the shelter of
snow-mountains, to the pallor of fluttering night-moths,
throwing out their clusters in sharp contrast against dark
rocks. The River Tarn, gliding onward through the gorge
toward the Garonne, was scaled with steel on its emerald
back, like a twisting serpent. Over a bed of gravel, white
as scattered pearls, the sequined lengths coiled on; and
the snake-green water, the strange burnt-coral vegetation
like a trail of blood among the pearls, the young foliage of
trees, filmy as wisps of blowing gauze, were the only
vestiges of colour that the moon allowed to live in the
under-world which we had reached. But above, on
the roof of that world&mdash;"les Causses"&mdash;where we had
left ice and snow, we could see purple chimneys of rock
rising to an opal sky, and now and then a mountain bonfire,
like a great open basket of witch-rubies, glowing
beneath the moon.</p>

<p>"This is the last haunt of the fairies," I said under
my breath, but the man by my side heard the murmur.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd find that out," he said. "Trust
you to get telepathic messages from the elf-folk! Why,
this gorge teems with fairy tales and legends of magic,
black and white. The Rhine Valley and the Black Forest
together haven't as many or as wonderful ones. I should
like you to hear the stories from some of the village people
or the boatmen. They believe them to this day."</p>

<p>"Why, <i>of course</i>," I said, gravely. Then, a question
wanted so much to be asked, that when I refused it asked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>itself in a great hurry, before I could even catch it by its
lizard-tail. "Was <i>she</i> with you when you were here
before?"</p>

<p>"She?" he echoed. "I don't understand."</p>

<p>"The lady of the battlement garden," I explained,
ashamed and repentant now that it was too late.</p>

<p>He did not answer for a moment. Then he laughed,
an odd sort of laugh. "Oh, my romance of the battlement
garden? Yes, she was with me in this gorge. She
is with me now."</p>

<p>"I wonder if she is thinking about you to-night?" I
asked, knowing he meant that the mysterious lady was
carried along on this journey in his spirit, as I was in
the car.</p>

<p>"Not seriously, if at all," he answered, with what seemed
to me a forced lightness. "But I am thinking of her&mdash;thoughts
which she will probably never know."</p>

<p>Then I did wish that I, too, had a hidden sorrow in
my life, a man in the background, but as unlike Monsieur
Charretier as possible, for whose love I could call upon
my brother's sympathy. And I suppose it was because
he had some one, while I had no one, in this strange,
hidden fairyland like a secret orchard of jewelled fruits,
that I felt suddenly very sad.</p>

<p>He pointed out Castlebouc, a spellbound ch&acirc;teau on
a towering crag that held it up as if on a tall black finger,
above a village which might have fallen off a canvas by
Gustave Dor&eacute;. Farther on lay a strange place called
Prades, memorable for a huge buttress of rock exactly
like the carcass of a mammoth petrified and hanging on a
wall. Then, farther on still, over the black face of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>rocks flashed a whiteness of waving waters, pouring cascades
like bridal veils whose lace was made of mountain snows.</p>

<p>"Here we are at Ste. Enemie," said Mr. Dane. "Don't
you remember about her&mdash;'King Dagobert's daughter,
ill-fated and fair to look upon?' Well, at this village of
hers we must either light our lamps or rest for the night,
which ever Sir Samuel&mdash;I mean her ladyship&mdash;decides."</p>

<p>So he stopped, in a little town which looked a place of
fairy enchantment under the moon. And as the song
of the motor changed into jogging prose with the putting
on of the brakes, open flew the door of an inn. Nothing
could ever have looked half so attractive as the rosy glow
of the picture suddenly revealed. There was a miniature
hall and a quaint stairway&mdash;just an impressionist glimpse
of both in play of firelight and shadow. With all my
might I willed Lady Turnour to want to stay the night.
The whole force of my mind pressed upon that part of her
"transformation" directly over the deciding-cells of her brain.</p>

<p>The chauffeur jumped down, and respectfully inquired
the wishes of his passengers. Would they remain here,
if there were rooms to be had, and take a boat in the
morning to make the famous descent of the Tarn, while the
car went on to meet them at Le Rosier, at the end of the
Gorge? Or would they, in spite of the darkness, risk&mdash;</p>

<p>"We'll risk nothing," Lady Turnour promptly cut
him short. "We've run risks to-day till I feel as if
I'd been in my grave and pulled out again. No more
for me, by dark, <i>thank</i> you, if I have to sleep in the car!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>"I hope your ladyship won't have to do that," returned
my Fellow Worm, alive though trodden under foot. "I
have never spent a night in Ste. Enemie, but I've lunched
here, and the food is passable. I should think the rooms
would be clean, though rough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't find this country attractive enough to pay
us for any hardships," said the mistress of our fate. "I
never was in such a dreary, God-forsaken waste! Are
there no decent hotels to get at?"</p>

<p>Patiently he explained to her, as he had to me, how the
better hotels which the Gorge of the Tarn could boast
were not yet open for the summer. "If we had not
had such a chapter of accidents we should have run
through as far as this early in the day, and could then
have followed the good motoring road down the gorge,
seeing its best sights almost as well as from the river; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whose fault were the accidents, I should like to know?"
demanded the lady. But obviously there was no answer
to that question from a servant to a mistress.</p>

<p>"Shall I inquire about rooms?" the chauffeur asked, calmly.</p>

<p>And it ended in Sir Samuel going in with him, conducted
by a smiling and somewhat excited young person
who had been holding open the door.</p>

<p>They must have been absent for ten minutes, which
seemed half an hour. Then, when Lady Turnour had
begun muttering to herself that she was freezing, Sir
Samuel bustled back, in a cheerfulness put on awkwardly,
like an ill-fitting suit of armour in a pageant.</p>

<p>"My dear, they're very full, but two French gentlemen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>were kind enough to give up their room to us, and the
landlady'll put them out somewhere&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, you and I both squashed into one room!"
exclaimed her ladyship, forgetful, in haughty horror,
of her lodging-house background.</p>

<p>"But it's all they have. It's that or the motor, since
you won't risk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, then, I suppose it can't <i>kill</i> me!" groaned
the bride, stepping out of the car as if from tumbril to scaffold.</p>

<p>What a way to take an adorable adventure! I was
sorry for Sir Samuel, but dimly I felt that I ought to be
still sorrier for a woman temperamentally unable to enjoy
anything as it ought to be enjoyed. Next year, maybe,
she will look back on the experience and tell her friends
that it was "fun"; but oh, the pity of it, not to gather the
flowers of the Present, to let them wither, and never pluck
them till they are dried wrecks of the Past!</p>

<p>I was ready to dance for joy as I followed her ladyship
into the miniature hall which, if not quite so alluring when
viewed from the inside, had a friendly, welcoming air
after the dark mountains and cold white moonlight. I
didn't know yet what arrangements had been made
for my stable accommodation, if any, but I felt that I
shouldn't weep if I had to sit up all night in a warm
kitchen with a purry cat and a snory dog.</p>

<p>The stairs were bare, and our feet clattered crudely
as we went up, lighted by a stout young girl with bared
arms, who carried a candle. "What a hole!" snapped
Lady Turnour; but when the door of a bedroom was
opened for her by the red-elbowed one, she cried out in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>despair. "Is <i>this</i> where you expect me to sleep, Samuel?
I'm surprised at you! I'm not sure it isn't an insult!"</p>

<p>"My darling, what can <i>I</i> do?" implored the unfortunate
bridegroom.</p>

<p>The red-elbowed maiden, beginning to take offence, set
the candlestick down on a narrow mantelpiece, with a
slap, and removed herself from the room with the dignity
of a budding Jeanne d'Arc. We all three filed in, I in the
rear; and for one who won't accept the cup of life as the
best champagne the prospect certainly was depressing.</p>

<p>The belongings of the "two gentlemen" who were
giving up their rights in a lady's favour, had not yet been
transferred to the "somewhere outside." Those slippers
under the bed could have belonged to no species of human
being but a commercial traveller; and on the table and
one chair were scattered various vague collars, neckties,
and celluloid cuffs. There was no fire in the fireplace,
nor, by the prim look of it, had there ever been one in the
half century or so since necessity called for an inn to be built.</p>

<p>I snatched from the chair a waistcoat tangled up in
some suspenders, and Lady Turnour, flinging herself down
in her furs, burst out crying like a cross child.</p>

<p>"If this is what you call adventure, Samuel, I hate it,"
she whimpered. "You <i>would</i> bring me motoring! I
want a fire. I want hot water. I want them now. And
I want the room cleared and all these awful things taken
away this instant. I don't consider them <i>decent</i>. Whatever
happens, I shan't dream of getting into that bed
to-night, and I don't feel now as if I should eat any dinner."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>Distracted, Sir Samuel looked piteously at me, and I
sprang to the rescue. I assured her ladyship that everything
should be made nice for her before she quite knew
what had happened. If she would have patience for
<i>five</i> minutes, <i>only</i> five, she should have everything she
wanted. I would see to it myself. With that I ran
away, followed by Sir Samuel's grateful eyes. But, once
downstairs, I realized what a task I had set myself.</p>

<p>The whole establishment had gone mad over us.
There had been enough to do before, with the house full
of <i>ces messieurs</i>, <i>les commis voyageurs</i>,
but it was comparatively
simple to do for them. For <i>la noblesse Anglaise</i>
it was different.</p>

<p>There were no men to be seen, and the three or four
women of the household were scuttling about crazily in
the kitchen, like hens with their heads cut off. The
patronage was so illustrious and so large; there was so
much to do and all at once, therefore nobody tried to do
anything but cackle and plump against one another.</p>

<p>Enter Me, a whirlwind, demanding an immediate
fire and hot water for washing. Landlady and assistants
were aghast. There had never been anything in any
bedroom fireplace of the inn less innocent than paper
flowers; bedroom fireplaces were for paper flowers;
while as for washing it was a <i>b&ecirc;tise</i> to want to do so in
the evening, especially with hot water, which was a madness
at any time, unless by doctor's orders. Besides,
did not mademoiselle see that everybody had more than
they could do already, in preparing dinner for the great
people! There was plenty of time to put the bedroom
in order when it should be bedtime. If the noble lady
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>were so fatigued that she must lie down, why, the bed had
only been slept in for one night by two particularly sympathetic
messieurs. It would be <i>presque un crime</i> to change
linen after so brief an episode, nevertheless for a client
of such importance it should eventually be done.</p>

<p>For a moment I was dashed by this volume of eloquence,
but not for long, for I was pledged. A wild glance round
the kitchen showed me a kettle standing empty in a corner.
I seized it, and though it was heavy, swung it to an open
door near which I could see a ghostly pump. I flew out,
and seized that ghost by its long and rigid arm.</p>

<p>"Let me," said a voice.</p>

<p>It was the voice of Mr. Jack Dane.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>


<p>"You dear!" I thought. But I only said, "How
sweet of you!" in a nice, ladylike tone. And
while he pumped the wettest and coldest water
I ever felt, he drily advised me to call him "Adversity" if
I found his "uses sweet," since he wasn't to be Jack
for me. What if he had known that I always call him
"Jack" to myself?</p>

<p>He not only pumped the kettle full, but carried it
into the kitchen, and bullied or flattered the goddesses
there until they gave him the hottest place for it on the
red-hot stove. Meanwhile, as my eyes accustomed themselves
to darkness after light, I spied in the courtyard of
the pump a shed piled with wood; and my uncomfortably
prophetic soul said that if Lady Turnour were to have a
fire, the woodpile and I must do the trick together. Souls
can be mistaken though, sometimes, if consciences never
can; and Brother Adversity contradicted mine by darting
out again to see what I was doing, ordering me to stop,
and doing it all himself.</p>

<p>I ran to beg for immediate bed-linen while he annexed
a portion of the family woodpile, and we met outside my
mistress's door. On the threshold I confidently expected
her grateful ladyship to say: "What <i>are</i> you doing with
that wood, Dane?" But she was too much crushed
under her own load of cold and discomfort to object to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>his and wish it transferred to me. I'd knelt down to
make a funeral pyre of paper roses, when in a voice low
yet firm my brother ordered me to my feet. This wasn't
work for girls when men were about, he grumbled; and
perhaps it was as well, for I never made a wood fire in
my life. As for him, he might have been a fire-tamer, so
quickly did the flames leap up and try to lick his hands.
When it was certain that they couldn't go stealthily
crawling away again, he shot from the room, and in two
minutes was back with the big kettle of hot water under
whose weight I should have staggered and fallen, perhaps.</p>

<p>By this time I had made the bed, and tumbled all
reminders of the two "sympathetic messieurs" ruthlessly
into no-man's land outside the door. Things began to
look more cheerful. Lady Turnour brightened visibly;
and when appetizing smells of cooking stole through the
wide cracks all round the door she decided that, after all,
she would dine.</p>

<p>It was not until after I had seen her descend with her
husband, and had finished unpacking, that I had a chance
to think of my own affairs. Then I did wonder on what
shelf I was to lie, or on what hook hang, for the night. I
had no information yet as regarded my own sleeping or
eating, but both began to assume importance in my eyes,
and I went down to learn my fate. Where was I to dine?
Why, in the kitchen, to be sure, since the <i>salle &agrave; manger</i> was
in use as a sitting-room until bedtime. As for sleeping&mdash;why,
that was a difficult matter. It was true that the
English milord had spoken of a room for me, but in the
press of business it had been forgotten. What a pity that
the chauffeur and I were not a married couple, <i>n'est pas?</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
That would make everything quite simple. But&mdash;as
it was, no doubt there was a box-room, and matters
would arrange themselves when there was time to attend
to them.</p>

<p>"Matters have already arranged themselves," announced
Mr. Jack Dane, from the door of the pump-court. "I
heard Sir Samuel speak about your accommodation, and
I saw that nothing was being done, so I discovered the
box-room, and it is now ready, all but bed-covering. And
for fear there might be trouble about that, I've put Lady
Turnour's cushions and rugs on the alleged bed. Would
you like to have a look at your quarters now, or are you
too hungry to care?"</p>

<p>"I'm not too hungry to thank you," I exclaimed.
"You are a kind of genie, who takes care of the poor who
have neither lamps nor rings to rub."</p>

<p>"Better not thank me till you've seen the place," said
he. "It's a villainous den; but I didn't think any one
here would be likely to do better with it than I would.
Anyhow, you'll find hot water. I unearthed&mdash;literally&mdash;another
kettle. And it's the first door at the top of
the back stairs."</p>

<p>I flew, or rather stumbled, up the ladder-like stairway,
with a candle which I snatched from the high kitchen
mantelpiece, and at the top I laughed out, gaily. In the
narrow passage was a barricade of horrors which my
knight had dragged from the box-room. On strange old
hairy trunks of cowhide he had piled broken chairs,
bandboxes covered with flowered wall-paper, battered
clocks, chipped crockery, fire-irons, bundles done up in
blankets, and a motley collection of unspeakable odds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>and ends that would have made a sensational jumble
sale. I opened the low door, and peeped into the room
with which such liberties had been taken for my sake.
Although it was no more than a store cupboard, my
wonderful brother had contrived to give it quite an air
of coziness. The tiny window was open, and was doing
its best to drive out mustiness. A narrow hospital cot
stood against the wall, spread with a mattress quite an
inch thick, and piled with the luxurious rugs and cushions
from the motor car. I was sure Lady Turnour would
have preferred my sitting up all night or freezing coverless
rather than I should degrade her possessions by making
use of them; but Mr. Dane evidently hadn't thought
her opinion of importance compared with her maid's
comfort. Two wooden boxes, placed one upon another,
formed a wash-hand stand, which not only boasted a
beautiful blue tin basin, but a tumbler, a caraffe full of
water, and a not-much-cracked saucer ready for duty
as a soap-dish. The top box was covered with a rough,
clean towel, evidently filched from the kitchen, and this
piece of extra refinement struck me as actually touching.
A third box standing on end and spread with another
towel, proclaimed itself a dressing-table by virtue of at
least half a looking glass, lurking in one corner of a
battered frame, like a sinister, partially extinguished eye.
Other furnishings were a kitchen chair and a small
clothes-horse, to compensate for the absence of wall-hooks
or wardrobe. On the bare floor&mdash;oh, height of
luxury!&mdash;lay the fleecy white rug whose high mission it
was to warm the toes of Lady Turnour when motoring.
On the floor beside the box wash-hand stand, a small
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>kettle was pleasantly puffing, doing its best to heat the
room with its gusty breath; and the clothes-horse had a
saddle of towels which I shrewdly suspected had been
intended for her ladyship or some other guest of importance
in the house.</p>

<p>How these wonders had been accomplished in such a
short space of time, and by a man, too, would have passed
my understanding, had I not begun to know what manner
of man the chauffeur was. And to think that there was
a woman in the world who had known herself loved by
him, yet had been capable of sending him away!
If he would do such things as these for an acquaintance,
at best a "pal," what would he not do for a woman
beloved? I should have liked to duck that creature
under the pump in the court, on just such a nipping night
as this.</p>

<p>He had not forgotten my dressing bag, which was on
the bed, but I could not stop to open it. I had to run
down to the kitchen again, and tell him what I thought
of his miracles. He was not there, but, at the sound of
my voice, he appeared at the door of the court, drying his
hands, having doubtless been making his toilet at the
accommodating pump. In the crude light of unshaded
paraffin lamps with tin reflectors, he looked tired, and
I was sharply reminded of the nervous strain he had
gone through in that ordeal on the mountains, but he
smiled with the delight of a boy when I burst into thanks.</p>

<p>"It was jolly good exercise, and limbered me up a bit,
after sitting with my feet on the brake for so long," said
he. "May I have my dinner with you?"</p>

<p>My answer was rather enthusiastic, and that seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>to please him, too. A quarter of an hour later I came
down again, having made myself tidy meanwhile, in the
room which he had retrieved from the jungle. Had the
landlady but had the ordering of the change, my quarters
would have been fifty per cent. less attractive, I was
sure, and told my brother so.</p>

<p>We were both starving, but there was too much to do
in the dining-room for domestics to expect attention.
As for Monsieur le Chauffeur, he was informed that the
presence of a mechanician would be permitted in the
<i>salle &agrave; manger</i>, though a <i>femme de chambre</i> might not
enter there. I begged him to go, but, of course, I should
have been surprised if he had. "I have a plan worth
two of that," he said to me. "Do you remember the
picnic preparations we brought from N&icirc;mes? It seems
about a week ago, but it was only this morning. We
might as well try to eat on a battlefield as in this kitchen,
at present, and if we're kept waiting, we may develop
cannibal propensities. What about a picnic <i>&agrave; deux</i> in
the glass cage, with electric illuminations? The water's
still hot in the automatic heater under the floor, and
you shall be as warm as toast. Besides, I'll grab a jug
of blazing soup for a first course, and come back for
coffee afterward."</p>

<p>I clapped my hands as I used to when a child and my
fun-loving young parents proposed an open air f&ecirc;te.
"Oh, how too nice!" I cried. "If you don't think the
Turnours would be angry?"</p>

<p>"I think the labourers are worthy of their hire," said
he. "I'll fetch your coat for you. No, you're not to
come without it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>The car, it appeared, was lodged in the court; and my
brother's prophecies for the success of the picnic were
more than fulfilled. Never was such a feast! I got out
the gorgeous tea-basket, trembling with a guilty joy, and
Jack washed the white and gold cups and plates at the
pump between courses, I drying them with cotton waste,
which the car generously provided. Besides the cabbage
soup and good black coffee, foraging expeditions produced
apricot tarts, nuts, and raisins. We both agreed that
no food had ever tasted so good, and probably never
would again; but I kept to myself one thought which
crept into my mind. It seemed to me that nothing would
ever be really interesting in my life, when the chauffeur&mdash;the
terrible, dreaded chauffeur&mdash;should have gone
out of it forever. In a few weeks&mdash;but I wouldn't
think ahead; I put my soul to enjoying every minute,
even the tidying of the tea-basket after the picnic was
over, for that business he shared with me, like the rest.
And when I dreamed, by-and-by in my box-room, that
he was polishing my boots, Lady Turnour's boots, the
boots of the whole party, I waked up to tell myself that
it was most likely true.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>


<p>"You selfish little brute!" was my first address to
myself as I realized my Me-ness, between waking
and sleeping, in the morning at Ste. Enemie.
I had never asked Jack where and how he was going
to spend the night. Think of that, after all he had
done for me!</p>

<p>It was only just dawn, but already there was a stirring
under my window. Perhaps it was that which had
roused me, not the early prick of an awakening conscience.</p>

<p>The first thing I did to-day was (as it had been yesterday)
to bounce up and climb on to a chair to look out of
the high window; but it was a very different window
and a very different scene. I now discovered that
my room gave on the pump court, and to my surprise,
I saw that through the blue silk blinds of
the Aigle which were all closely drawn, a light was
streaming. This was very queer indeed, and must
mean something wrong. My imagination pictured a
modern highwayman inside, with the electric lamps
turned on to help him rifle the car, and I stood on tiptoe,
peering out of the tiny aperture which was close under
the low ceiling of the box-room. Ought I to scream,
and alarm the household, since I knew not where to go
and call the chauffeur?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>To be sure, there was very little, if anything, of value,
which a thief could carry away, but an abandoned villain
might revenge himself for disappointment by slashing
the tyres, or perhaps even by setting the car on fire.</p>

<p>At the thought of such a catastrophe, which would
bring the trip to an end and separate me at once from the
society of my brother (I'm afraid I cared much more
about losing him than for the Turnours' loss of their
Aigle) I was impelled to run down in my nightgown and
<i>mules</i> to do battle single-handed with the ruffian; but
suddenly, before I had quite decided, out went the light
in the blue-curtained glass cage. In another instant
the car door opened, and Jack Dane quietly got out.</p>

<p>In a second I understood. I knew now, without
asking, where he had spent his night. Poor fellow&mdash;after
such a day!</p>

<p>Someone spoke to him&mdash;someone who had been making
that disturbing noise in the woodshed. The household
was astir, and I would be astir, too. I didn't yet know
what was to happen to-day, but I wanted to know, and
I was prepared to find any plan good, since, in a country
like this, all roads must lead to Adventures. My one
fear was, that if the Turnours took to a boat, I should
have to go with them to play cloak-bearer, or hot-water-bag-carrier,
while the car whirled away, free and glorious.
The thought of a whole day in my master's and mistress's
society, undiluted by the saving presence of my adopted
brother, was like bolting a great dry crust of yesterday's
bread. What an indigestion I should have!</p>

<p>I was too wise, however, to betray the slightest anxiety
one way or the other; for if her ladyship suspected me of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>presuming to have a preference she would punish me by
crushing it, even if inconvenient to herself. I was exquisitely
meek and useful, lighting her fire (with wood brought
me by Jack) supplying her with hot water, and wrangling
with the landlady over her breakfast, which would have
consisted of black coffee and unbuttered bread, had it not
been for my exertions. Breakfasts more elaborate were
unknown at Ste. Enemie; but coaxings and arguments
produced boiled eggs, goats' milk, and <i>confiture</i>, which I
added to the repast, and carried up to Lady Turnour's room.</p>

<p>No definite plans had been made even then; but
harassed Sir Samuel told his chauffeur to engage a boat,
and have it ready "in case her ladyship had a whim to
go in it." The motor was to be in readiness simultaneously,
and then the lady could choose between the two
at the last moment.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood when my mistress appeared at
the front door, hatted and coated. At last she must
decide whether she would descend the rapids of the Tarn
(quite safe, kind rapids, which had never done their worst
enemies any harm), or travel by a newly finished road
through the gorge, in the car, missing a few fine bits of
scenery and an experience, but, it was to be supposed,
enjoying extra comfort. There was the big blue car;
there was the swift green river, and on the river a boat
with two respectful and not unpicturesque boatmen.</p>

<p>"Ugh! the water looks hideously cold and dangerous,"
she sighed, shivering in the clear sunlight, despite her
long fur coat. "But I have a horror of the motor, since
yesterday. I <i>may</i> get over it, but it will take me days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
It's a hateful predicament&mdash;between <i>two</i> evils, one
as bad as the other. I oughtn't to have been subjected to it."</p>

<p>"Dane says everyone does go by the river. It's the
thing to do," ventured Sir Samuel, becoming subtle.
"They've put a big foot-warmer in the boat, and you can
have your own rugs. There's a place where we land, by
the way, to get a hot lunch."</p>

<p>With a moan, the bride pronounced for the boat, which
was a big flat-bottomed punt, as reliable in appearance as
pictures of John Bull. I fetched her rugs from the car.
She was helped into the boat, and then, as my fate remained
to be settled, I asked her in a voice soft as silk what were
her wishes in regard to her handmaiden.</p>

<p>"Why, you'll come with us in the boat, of course.
What else did you dream?" she replied sharply.</p>

<p>Down went my heart with a thump like a fish dropping
off its hook. But as I would have moved toward the
pebbly beach, a champion rode to my defence.</p>

<p>"Your ladyship doesn't think a load of five might
disturb the balance of the boat?" mildly suggested the
chauffeur. "The usual load is two passengers and two
boatmen; and though there's no danger in the rapids if&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not give him time to finish. "Oh, very well,
you must stop with the car, Elise," said she. "It is
only one inconvenience more, among many. No doubt
I can put up with it. Get me the brandy flask out of the
tea-basket."</p>

<p>I would have tried to scoop all the green cheese out of
the moon for her, if she had asked me, I was so delighted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
And part of my joy was mixed up with the thought that
<i>he</i> wanted me to be with him. He had actually schemed
to get me! I envied no one in the world, not even the
lovely lady of the battlement garden. He was mine for
to-day, in spite of her&mdash;so there!</p>

<p>Sir Samuel got into the boat, and wrapped his wife in
rugs. The boatmen pushed off. Away the flat-bottomed
punt slid down the clear green stream, the sun shining,
the cascades sparkling, the strange precipices which wall
the gorge, copper-tinted in the morning light. It was the
most wonderful world; yet Lady Turnour was cackling
angrily. Was she afraid? Had she changed her mind?
No, the saints be praised! She was only burning holes
in her petticoat on the brazier supplied by the hotel! I
turned away to hide a smile almost as wicked as a grin,
and before I looked round again, the swift stream had
swept the boat out of sight round a jutting corner
of rock. We were safe. This time it really <i>was</i> our
world, our car, and our everything. We didn't even
need to "pretend."</p>

<p>Ste. Enemie is only at the gates of the gorge&mdash;a
porter's lodge, so to speak, and in the Aigle we sped on
into the fairyland of which we'd had our first pale,
moonlit peep last night. There were castles made by
man, and castles made by gnomes; but the gnomes were
the better architects. Their dwellings, carved of rock,
towered out of the river to a giddy height, and some were
broken in half, as if they had been rent asunder by
gnome cannon, in gnome battles. There were gnome
villages, too, which looked exactly like human habitations,
with clustering roofs plastered against the mountain-side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
But the hand of man had not placed one of these stones
upon another.</p>

<p>There were gigantic rock statues, and watch-towers
for gnomes to warn old-time gnome populations, perhaps,
when their enemies, the cave-dwellers, were coming that
way from a mammoth-hunt; and there was a wonderful
grotto, fitted with doors and windows, a grotto whose
occupants must surely have inherited the mansion from
their ancestors, the cave-dwellers. Every step of the way
History, gaunt and war-stained, stalked beside us,
followed hot-foot by his foster-mother, Legend; and the
first stories of the one and the last stories of the other
were tangled inextricably together.</p>

<p>Legend and history were alike in one regard; both
told of brave men and beautiful women; and the people
we met as we drove, looked worthy of their forebears who
had fought and suffered for religion and independence,
in this strange, rock-walled corridor, shared with fairies
and gnomes. The men were tall, with great bold, good-natured
eyes and apple-red cheeks, to which their indigo
blouses gave full value. The women were of gentle
mien, with soft glances; and the children were even
more attractive than their elders. Tiny girls, like walking
dolls, with dresses to the ground, bobbed us curtseys;
and sturdy little boys, curled up beside ancient grandfathers,
in carts with old boots protecting the brakes,
saluted like miniature soldiers, or pulled off their quaint
round caps, as they stared in big-eyed wonder at our
grand, blue car. For them we were prince and princess,
not chauffeur and maid.</p>

<p>Sometimes our road through the gorge climbed high
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>above the rushing green river, and ran along a narrow
shelf overhanging the ravine, but clear of snow and ice;
sometimes it plunged down the mountain-side as if on
purpose to let us hear the music of the water; and one
of these sudden swoops downward brought us in sight
of a ch&acirc;teau so enchanting and so evidently enchanted,
that I was sure a fairy's wand had waved for its creation,
perhaps only a moment before. When we were gone,
it would disappear again, and the fairy would flash down
under the translucent water, laughing, as she sent up a
spray of emeralds and pearls.</p>

<p>"Of course, it isn't real!" I exclaimed. "But do
let's stop, because such a knightly castle wouldn't be
rude enough to vanish right before our eyes."</p>

<p>"No, it won't vanish, because it's a most courteous
little castle, which has been well brought up, and even
though its greatness is gone, tries to live up to its traditions,"
said Jack. "It always appears to everyone it
thinks likely to appreciate it; and I was certain it would
be here in its place to welcome you."</p>

<p>We smiled into each other's eyes, and I felt as if the
castle were a present from him to me. How I should
have loved to have it for mine, to make up for one poor
old ch&acirc;teau, now crumbled hopelessly into ruin, and
despised by the least exacting of tourists! Coming upon
it unexpectedly in this green dell, at the foot of the precipice,
seeing it rise from the water on one side, reflected
as in a broken mirror, and draped in young, golden
foliage on the other, it really was an ideal castle for a
fairy tale. A connoisseur in the best architecture of the
Renaissance would perhaps have been ungracious enough
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>to pick faults; for to a critical eye the turrets and
arches might fall short of perfection; and there was
little decoration on the time-darkened stone walls, save
the thick curtain of old, old ivy; but the fairy grace
of the towers rising from the moat of glittering, bright
green water was gay and sweet as a song heard in
the woods.</p>

<p>"Some beautiful nymph ought to have lived here," I
said dreamily, when we had got out of the car. "A
nymph whose beauty was celebrated all over the world,
so that knights from far and near came to this lovely
place to woo her."</p>

<p>"Why, you might have heard the story of the place!"
said Jack. "It's the Ch&acirc;teau de la Caze, usually
called the Castle of the Nymphs, for instead of one,
eight beautiful nymphs lived in it. But their beauty
was their undoing. I don't quite know why they were
called 'nymphs,' for nymphs and naiads had gone out
of fashion when they reigned here as Queens of Beauty,
in the sixteenth century. But perhaps in those days to
call a girl a 'nymph' was to pay her a compliment. It
wouldn't be now, when chaps criticize the 'nymphery'
if they go to a dance! Anyhow, these eight sisters,
were renowned for their loveliness, and all the unmarried
gentlemen of France&mdash;according to the story&mdash;as well
as foreign knights, came to pay court to them. The
unfortunate thing was, when the cavaliers saw the eight
girls together, they were all so frightfully pretty it wasn't
possible to choose between them, so the poor gentlemen
fought over their rival charms, and were either killed or
went away unable to make up their minds. The sad end
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>was, if you'll believe me, that all the eight maidens died
unmarried, martyrs to their own incomparable charms."</p>

<p>"I can quite believe it," I answered, "and it wasn't
at all sad, because I'm sure any girl who had once had
this place for her home would have pined in grief at being
taken away, even by the most glorious knight of the world."</p>

<p>"Come in and see their boudoir," said the knight who
worked, if he did not fight, for me.</p>

<p>So we went in, without the trouble of using battering
rams; for alas, the family of the eight nymphs grew tired
of their ch&acirc;teau and the gorge in the dreadful days of
the religious wars, and now it is an hotel. It would not
receive paying guests until summer, but a good-natured
caretaker opened the door for us, and we saw a number
of stone-paved corridors, and the nymphs' boudoir.</p>

<p>Their adoring father had ordered their portraits to be
painted on the ceiling; and there they remain to this
day, simpering sweetly down upon the few bits of ancient
furniture made to match the room and suit their taste.</p>

<p>They smiled amiably at us, too, the eight little faces
framed in Henrietta Maria curls; and their eyes said
to me, "If you want to be happy, <i>m'amie</i>, it is better not
to be too beautiful; or else not to have any sisters. Or
if Providence <i>will</i> send you sisters, go away yourself, and
visit your plainest friend, till you have got a husband."</p>

<p>Gazing wistfully back, as one does gaze at places
one fears never to see again, the Castle of the Nymphs
looked like a fantastic water-flower standing up out of
the green river, on its thick stem of rock. Then it was
gone; for our time was not quite our own, and we dared
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>not linger, lest the boat with our Betters should arrive
at the meeting place before we reached it in the car. But
there were compensations, for almost with every moment
the gorge grew grander. Cascades sparkled in the sun
like blowing diamond-dust. The rocks seemed set with
jewels, or patterned with mosaic; and there were caves&mdash;caves
almost too good to be true. Yet if we could believe
our eyes, they were true, even the dark cavern where,
once upon a time, lived a scaly dragon who terrorized
the whole country for miles around, and had no relish
for his meals unless they were composed of the most
exquisite young maidens&mdash;though he would accept a
child as an <i>hors d'oeuvre</i>. In such a strange world as
this, after all, it was no harder to believe in dragons, than
in hiding countesses, fed and tended for months upon
months by faithful servants, while the red Revolution
raged; yet the countess and her cave were vouched for
by history, which ignored the dragon and his.</p>

<p>Not only had each mountain at least one cavern, but
every really eligible crag had its ruined castle; and each
ruin had its romance, which clung like the perfume of
roses to a shattered vase. There were rocks shaped
like processions of marching monks following uplifted
crucifixes; and farther on, one would have thought that
half the animals had scrambled out of the ark to a height
where they had petrified before the flood subsided. As
we wound through the gorge the landscape became so
strange, hewn in such immensity of conception, that it
seemed prehistoric. We, in the blue car, were anachronisms,
or so I felt until I remembered how, in pre-motoring
days, I used to think that owning an automobile must be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>like having a half-tamed minotaur in the family. As
for the Aigle, she was a friendly, not a vicious, monster,
and as if to make up for her mistakes of yesterday, she
was to-day more like a demi-goddess serving an earthly
apprenticeship in fulfilment of a vow than a dragon
of any sort. Swinging smoothly round curve after curve,
the noble car running free and cooing in sheer joy of
fiery life, as she swooped from height to depth, I, too, felt
the joy of life as I had hardly ever felt it before. The
chauffeur and I did not speak often, but I looked up at
him sometimes because of the pleasure I had in seeing
and re-seeing the face in which I had come to have perfect
confidence; and I fancied from its expression that
he felt as I felt.</p>

<p>So we came to Les Vignes, and lunched together at a
table set out of doors, close to the car, that she might not
be left alone. We had for food a strange and somewhat
evil combination; wild hare and wild boar; but they
seemed to suit the landscape somehow, as did the mystical
music of the conch-shells, blown by passing boatmen.
It was like being waked from a dream of old-time romance,
by a rude hand shaking one's shoulder, to hear the voices
of Sir Samuel and Lady Turnour, he mildly arguing, she
disputing, as usual.</p>

<p>Poetry fled like a dryad of some classic wood, scared
by a motor omnibus; and, though the gorge as far as
Le Rozier was magnificent, and the road all the way to
Millau beautiful in the sunset, it was no longer <i>our</i>
gorge, or <i>our</i> road. That made a difference!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>


<p>There was a telegram from "Bertie" at Millau.
The invitation to the ch&acirc;teau where he was stopping
near Clermont-Ferrand, had been asked for
and given. I heard all about it, of course, from the conversation
between the bride and groom; for Lady Turnour
prides herself on discussing things in my presence, as if
I were deaf or a piece of furniture. She has the idea
that this trick is a habit of the "smart set"; and she would
allow herself to be tarred and feathered, in Directoire
style, if she could not be smart at smaller cost.</p>

<p>Nothing was ever more opportune than that telegram,
for her ladyship had burnt her frock and chilled her
liver in the boat, and though the hotel at Millau was
good, she arrived there with the evident intention of making
life a burden to Sir Samuel. The news from Bertie
changed all that, however; and though the weather was
like the breath of icebergs next morning, Lady Turnour
was warmed from within. She chatted pleasantly with
Sir Samuel about the big luggage which had gone on to
Clermont-Ferrand, and asked his advice concerning the
becomingness of various dresses. The one unpleasant
thing she allowed herself to say, was that "certainly
Bertie wasn't doing this for nothing," and that his stepfather
might take her word for it, Bertie would be neither
slow nor shy in naming his reward. But Sir Samuel only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>grinned, and appeared rather amused than otherwise at
the shrewdness of his wife's insight into the young man's
character.</p>

<p>I was conscious that my jacket hadn't been made for
motoring, when I came out into the sharp morning air
and took my place in the Aigle. I was inclined to envy
my mistress her fur rugs, but to my surprise I saw lying
on my seat a Scotch plaid, plaider than any plaid ever
made in Scotland.</p>

<p>"Does that belong to the hotel?" I asked the chauffeur,
as he got into the car.</p>

<p>"It belongs to you," said he. "A present from Millau
for a good child."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"But I have," he returned, calmly. "I'm not going
to watch you slowly freezing to death by my side; for
it won't be exactly summer to-day. Let me tuck you
in prettily."</p>

<p>I groaned while I obeyed. "I've been an expense
to you all the way, because you wouldn't abandon me
to the lions, even in the most expensive hotels, where I
knew you wouldn't have stayed if it hadn't been for me.
And now, <i>this!</i>"</p>

<p>"It cost only a few francs," he tried to reassure me.
"We'll sell it again&mdash;afterward, if that will make you
happier. But sufficient for the day is the rug thereof&mdash;at
least, I hope it will be. And don't flaunt it, for if her
ladyship sees there's an extra rug of any sort on board
she'll be clamouring for it by and by."</p>

<p>Northward we started, in the teeth of the wind, which
made mine chatter until I began to tingle with the rush
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>of ozone, which always goes to my head like champagne.
Our road was a mere white thread winding loosely through
a sinuous valley, and pulled taut as it rose nearer and
nearer to the cold, high level of <i>les Causses</i>, the roof of that
gnome-land where we had journeyed together yesterday.
From snow-covered billows which should have been
sprayed with mountain wild-flowers by now, a fierce blast
pounced down on us like a swooping bird of prey. We
felt the swift whirr of its wings, which almost took our
breath away, and made the Aigle quiver; but like a bull
that meets its enemy with lowered horns, the brave car's
bonnet seemed to defy the wind and face it squarely. We
swept on toward the snow-reaches whence the wind-torrent
came. Soon we were on the flat plateau of the
Causse, where last year's faded grass was frosted white,
and a torn winding-sheet wrapped the limbs of a dead
world. There was no beauty in this death, save the wild
beauty of desolation, and a grandeur inseparable from
heights. Before us grouped the mountains of Auvergne,
hoary headed; and looking down we could see the twistings
of the road we had travelled, whirling away and
away, like the blown tail of a kite trailed over mountain
and foothill.</p>

<p>"The people at Millau told me I should get up to St.
Flour all right, in spite of the fall of snow," said the
chauffeur, his eyes on the great white waves that piled
themselves against a blue-white sky, "but I begin to think
there's trouble before us, and I don't know whether I
ought to have persisted in bringing you."</p>

<p>"Persisted!" I echoed, defending him against himself.
"Why, do you suppose wild horses would have dragged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Lady Turnour in any other direction, now that she's
actually invited to be the guest of a marquis in a real
live castle?"</p>

<p>"A railway train could very well have dragged her in
the same direction and got her to the castle as soon, if not
a good deal sooner than she's likely to get in this
car, if we have to fight snow. I proposed this way
originally because I wanted you to see the Gorge of the
Tarn, and because I thought that you'd like Clermont-Ferrand,
and the road there. It was to be <i>your</i> adventure,
you know, and I shall feel a brute if I let you in for a worse
one than I bargained for. Even this morning it wasn't
too late. I could have hinted at horrors, and they would
have gone by rail like lambs, taking you with them."</p>

<p>"Lady Turnour can do nothing like a lamb," I
contradicted him. "I should never have forgiven you
for sending me away from&mdash;the car. Besides, Lady
Turnour wants to teuf-teuf up to the ch&acirc;teau in her
sixty-horse-power Aigle, and make an impression on the
aristocracy."</p>

<p>"Well, we must hope for the best now," said he. "But
look, the snow's an inch thick by the roadside even at
this level, so I don't know what we mayn't be in for,
between here and St. Flour, which is much higher&mdash;the
highest point we shall have to pass in getting to the
Ch&acirc;teau de Roquemartine, a few miles out of Clermont-Ferrand."</p>

<p>"You think we may get stuck?"</p>

<p>"It's possible."</p>

<p>"Well, that <i>would</i> be an adventure. You know I love
adventures."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>"But I know the Turnours don't. And if&mdash;" He
didn't finish his sentence.</p>

<p>Higher we mounted, until half France seemed to lie
spread out before us, and a solitary sign-post with "Paris-Perpignans"
suggested unbelievable distances. The Aigle
glided up gradients like the side of a somewhat toppling
house, and scarcely needed to change speed, so well did
she like the rarefied mountain air. I liked it too, though
I had to be thankful for the plaid; and above all I liked
the wild loneliness of the Causse, which was unlike anything
I ever saw or imagined. The savage monotony
of the heights was broken just often enough by oases of
pine wood; and the plains on which we looked down were
blistered with conical hills, crowned by ancient castles
which would have rejoiced the hearts of medi&aelig;val painters,
as they did mine. Severac-le-Ch&acirc;teau, perched on its
naked pinnacle of rock, was best of all, as we saw it from
our bird's-eye view, and then again, almost startlingly
impressive when we had somehow whirled down below
it, to pass under its old huddled town, before we flew up
once more to higher and whiter levels.</p>

<p>Never had the car gone better; but Lady Turnour had
objected to the early start which the chauffeur wanted,
and the sun was nearly overhead when many a huge
shoulder of glittering marble still walled us away from our
journey's end. The cold was the pitiless cold of northern
midwinter, and I remembered with a shiver that Millau
and Clermont-Ferrand were separated from one another
by nearly two hundred and fifty kilometres of such mountain
roads as these. Oh yes, it was an experience, a
splendid, dazzling experience; nevertheless, my cowardly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>thoughts would turn, sunflower-like, toward warmth;
warm rooms, even stuffy rooms, without a single window
open, fires crackling, and hot things to drink. Still, I
wouldn't admit that I was cold, and stiffened my muscles
to prevent a shudder when my brother asked me cheerfully
if I would enjoy a visit to the Gouffre de Padirac, close by.</p>

<p>A "gouffre" on such a day! Not all the splendours
of the posters which I had often seen and admired, could
thrill me to a desire for the expedition; but I tried to
cover my real feelings with the excuse that it must now
be too late to make even a small d&eacute;tour. Mr. Jack Dane
laughed, and replied that he had no intention of making
it; he had only wanted to test my pluck. "I believe
you'd pretend to be delighted if I told you we had plenty
of time, and mustn't miss going," said he. "But don't
be frightened; this isn't a Gouffre de Padirac day, though
it really is a great pity to pass it by. What do you say
to lunch instead?"</p>

<p>And we rolled through a magnificent medi&aelig;val gateway
into the ancient and unpronounceable town of Marvejols.</p>

<p>Before he had time to make the same suggestion to his
more important passengers, it came hastily from within
the glass cage. So we stopped at an inn which proudly
named itself an hotel; and chauffeur and maid were
entertained in a kitchen destitute of air and full of clamour.
Nevertheless, it seemed a snug haven to us, and never
was any soup better than the soup of "Marvels," as Sir
Samuel and Lady Turnour called the place.</p>

<p>The word was "push on," however, for we had still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>the worst before us, and a long way to go. The Quality
had promised to finish its luncheon in an hour; and
well before the time was up, we two Worms were out in
the cold, each engaged in fulfilling its own mission. I
was arranging rugs; the chauffeur was pouring some
libation from a long-nosed tin upon the altar of his goddess
when our master appeared, wearing such an "I
haven't stolen the cream or eaten the canary" expression
that we knew at once something new was in the wind.</p>

<p>He coughed, and floundered into explanations. "The
waiter, who can speak some English, has been frightening
her ladyship," said he. "After the day before yesterday
she's grown a bit timid, and to hear that the cold she has
suffered from is nothing to what she may have to experience
higher up, and later in the day, as the sun gets down
behind the mountains, has put her off motoring. It
seems we can go on from here by train to Clermont-Ferrand
and that's what she wants to do. I hate deserting
the car, but after all, this <i>is</i> an expedition of pleasure, and
if her ladyship has a preference, why shouldn't it be
gratified?"</p>

<p>"Quite so, sir," responded the chauffeur, his face a blank.</p>

<p>"My first thought on making up my mind to the train
was to have the car shipped at the same time," went on
Sir Samuel, "but it seems that can't be done. There's
lots of red tape about such things, and the motor
might have to wait days on end here at Marvels, before
getting off, to say nothing of how long she might be on
the way. Whereas, I've been calculating, if you start
now and go as quick as you can, you ought to be at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>ch&acirc;teau" (he pronounced it 'chattoe') "before us. Our
train doesn't leave for more than an hour, and it's a very
slow one. Still, it will be warm, and we have cards and
Tauchnitz novels. Then, you know, you can unload the
luggage at the ch&acirc;teau and run back to the railway station
at Clermont-Ferrand, see to having our big boxes sent
out (they'll be there waiting for us) and meet our train.
What do you think of the plan?"</p>

<p>"It ought to do very well&mdash;if I'm not delayed on the
road by snow."</p>

<p>"Do you expect to be?"</p>

<p>"I hope not. But it's possible."</p>

<p>"Well, her ladyship has made up her mind, and we
must risk it. I'll trust you to get out of any scrape."</p>

<p>The chauffeur smiled. "I'll try not to get into one,"
he said. "And I'd better be off&mdash;unless you have
further instructions?"</p>

<p>"Only the receipt for the luggage. Here it is," said
Sir Samuel. "And here are the keys for you, Elise. Her
ladyship wants you to have everything unpacked by the
time she arrives. Oh&mdash;and the rugs! We shall need
them in the train."</p>

<p>"Isn't mademoiselle going with you?" asked my
brother, showing surprise at last.</p>

<p>"No. Her mistress thinks it would be better for her
to have everything ready for us at the 'chattoe.' You
see, it will be almost dinner-time when we get there."</p>

<p>"But, sir, if the car's delayed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," cut in Sir Samuel, "we must chance it, I'm
afraid. The fact is, her ladyship is in such a nervous
state that I don't care to put any more doubts into her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>head. She's made up her mind what she wants, and
we'd better let it go at that."</p>

<p>If I'd been near enough to my brother I should have
stamped on his foot, or seized some other forcible method
of suggesting that he should kindly hold his tongue. As
it was, my only hope lay in an imploring look, which he
did not catch. However, in pity for Sir Samuel he said
no more; and before we were three minutes older, if her
ladyship had yearned to have me back, it would have been
too late. We were off together, and another day had been
given to us for ours.</p>

<p>The chauffeur proposed that I should sit inside the car;
but I had regained all my courage in the hot inn-kitchen.
I was not cold, and didn't feel as if I should ever be cold
again.</p>

<p>The road mounted almost continuously. Sometimes,
as we looked ahead, it seemed to have been broken off
short just in front of the car, by some dreadful earth convulsion;
but it always turned out to be only a sudden dip
down, or a sharp turn like the curve of an apple-paring.
At last we had reached the highest peak of the Roof of
France&mdash;a sloping, snow-covered roof; but steep as was
the slant, very little of the snow appeared to have
slipped off.</p>

<p>The C&eacute;vennes on our right loomed near and bleak;
the Auvergne stretched endlessly before us, and the virgin
snow, pure as edelweiss, was darkened in the misty distance
by patches of shadow, purple-blue, like beds of early violets.</p>

<p>At first but a thin white sheet was spread over our road,
but soon the lace-like fabric was exchanged for a fleecy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>blanket, then a thick quilt of down, and the motor began
to pant. The winds seemed to come from all ways at
once, shrieking like witches, and flinging their splinters of
ice, fine and small as broken needles, against our cheeks.
Still I would not go inside. I could not bear to be warm
and comfortable while Jack faced the cold alone. I knew
his fingers must be stiff, though he wouldn't confess to
any suffering, and I wished that I knew how to drive the car,
so that we might have taken turns, sitting with our hands
in our pockets.</p>

<p>In the deepening snow we moved slowly, the wheels
slipping now and then, unable to grip. Then, on a
steep incline, there came a report like a revolver shot.
But it didn't frighten me now. I knew it meant a
collapsed tyre, not a concealed murderer; but there
couldn't have been a much worse place for "jacking up."
Nevertheless, it's an ill tyre that blows up for its own
good alone, and the forty minutes out of a waning afternoon
made the chauffeur's cold hands hot and the hot engine cold.</p>

<p>Starting on again, we had ten miles of desolation, then
a tiny hamlet which seemed only to emphasize that
desolation; again another ten-mile stretch of desert, and
another hamlet; here and there a glimpse of the railway line,
like a great black snake, lost in the snow; now and
then the gilded picture of an ancient town, crowning some
tall crag that stood up from the flat plain below like a
giant bottle. And there was one thrilling view of a high
viaduct, flinging a spider's web of glittering steel across a
vast and shadowy ravine. "Garabit!" said the chauffeur,
as he saw it; and I remembered that this road was not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>new for him. He did not talk much. Was he thinking
of the companion who perhaps had sat beside him before?
I wondered. Was it because he thought continually of
her that he looked at me wistfully sometimes, often in
silence, wishing me away, maybe, and the woman who
had spoilt his life by his side again for good or ill?</p>

<p>Suddenly we plunged into a deep snow-bank which
deceitfully levelled a dip in the road, and the car stopped,
trembling like a horse caught by the hind leg while in
full gallop.</p>

<p>On went the first speed, most powerful of all, but not
powerful enough to fight through snow nearly up to the
hubs. The Aigle was prisoned like a rat in a trap, and
could neither go back nor forward.</p>

<p>"Well?" I questioned, half laughing, half frightened,
at this fulfilment of the morning's prophecy.</p>

<p>"Sit still, and I'll try to push her through," said Jack
jumping out into the deep snow. "It's only a drift in a
hollow, you see; and we should have got by the worst,
just up there at St. Flour."</p>

<p>I looked where his nod indicated, and saw a town as
dark and seemingly as old as the rock out of which it
grew, climbing a conical hill, to dominate all the wide,
white reaches above which it stood, like an armoured
sentinel on a watch-tower. As I gazed, struck with admiration,
which for an instant made me forget our plight,
he began to push. The car, surprised at his strength
and determination, half decided to move, then changed
her mind and refused to budge. In a second, before he
could guess what I meant to do, I had flashed out of my
seat into the snow, and was wading in his tracks to help
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>him when he snatched me up&mdash;a hand on either side of
my waist&mdash;and swung me back into my place again.</p>

<p>"Little wretch!" he exclaimed. "How dare you disobey me?"</p>

<p>Then I was vexed, for it was ignominious to be treated
as a child, when I had wanted to aid him like a comrade.</p>

<p>"You are very unkind&mdash;very rude," I said. "You
wouldn't dare to do that, or speak like that to <i>Her</i>."</p>

<p>He laughed loudly. "What&mdash;haven't you forgotten
'Her?'" (As if I ever could!) "Well, I may tell you,
it's just because I did dare to 'speak like that' to a
woman, that I'm a chauffeur stuck in the snow with
another man's car, and the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The rest is another epithet which concerns me, I suppose,"
I remarked with dignity, though suddenly I felt
the chill of the icy air far, far more cruelly than I had
felt it yet. I was so cold, in this white desolation, that
it seemed I must die soon. And it wouldn't matter at
all if I were buried under the drifts, to be found in the late
spring with violets growing out of the places where my
eyes once had been.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, in that cool way he has, which can
be as irritating as a chilblain. "It was an epithet concerning
you, but luckily for me I stopped to think before
I spoke&mdash;an accomplishment I'm only just beginning to learn."</p>

<p>I swallowed something much harder and bigger than
a cannon ball, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Of course you're covered with snow up to your knees,
foolish child!" He was glaring ferociously at me.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>"It does matter most infernally. Don't you know
that you make no more than a featherweight of difference
to the car?"</p>

<p>"I feel as if I weighed a thousand pounds, now."</p>

<p>"It's that snow!"</p>

<p>"No. It's you. Your crossness. I <i>can't</i> have
people cross to me, on lonely mountains, just when I'm
trying to help them."</p>

<p>His glare of rage turned to a stare of surprise. "Cross?
Do you think I was cross to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And you just stopped in time, or you would
have been worse."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," he said. "You thought that the 'epithet'
was going to be invidious, did you?"</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"Well, it wasn't. I&mdash;no, I <i>won't</i> say it! That would
be the last folly. But&mdash;I wasn't going to be cross. I
can't have you think that, whatever happens. Now sit
still and be good, while I push again."</p>

<p>I weighed no more than half the thousand pounds now,
and the cannon ball had dissolved like a chocolate cream;
but the car stood like a rock, fixed, immutable.</p>

<p>"There ought to be half a dozen of me," said the chauffeur.
"Look here, little pal, there's nothing else for it;
I must trudge off to St. Flour and collect the missing five.
Are you afraid to be left here alone?"</p>

<p>Of course I said no; but when he had disappeared,
walking very fast, I thought of a large variety of horrors
that might happen; almost everything, in fact, from an
earthquake to a mad bull. As the sun leaned far down
toward the west, the level red light lay like pools of blood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>in the snow-hollows, and the shadows "came alive,"
as they used when I was a child lying awake, alone, watching
the play of the fire on wall and ceiling.</p>

<p>Long minutes passed, and at last I could sit still no
longer. Gaily risking my brother's displeasure, now I
knew that he wasn't "cross," I slipped out into the snow
again, opened the car door, stood in the doorway, hanging
on with one hand, and after much manoeuvring extricated
the tea-basket from among spare tyres and luggage
on the roof. Then, swinging it down, planted it inside
the car, opened it, and scooped up a kettleful of snow.
As soon as the big white lump had melted over a rose
and azure flame of alcohol, I added more snow, and still
more, until the kettle was filled with water. By the time
I had warmed and dried my feet on the automatic heater
under the floor, the water bubbled; and as jets of steam
began to pour from the spout I saw six figures
approaching, dark as if they had been cut out in black
velvet against the snow.</p>

<p>"Tea for seven!" I said to myself; but the kettle was
large, if the cups were few.</p>

<p>It took half an hour to dig the car out, and push her
up from the hollow where the snow lay thickest. When
she stood only a foot deep, she consented readily to move.
We bade good-bye to the five men, for whom we had
emptied our not-too-well filled pockets, and forged,
bumbling, past St. Flour. It was a great strain for a
heavy car, and the chauffeur only said, "I thought so!"
when a chain snapped five or six miles farther on.</p>

<p>"What a good thing Lady Turnour isn't here!" said I,
as he doctored the wounded Aigle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>"Lots of girls would be in a blue funk," said he. "I
could shake that beastly woman for not taking you with her."</p>

<p>"Oh!" I exclaimed. "When I'm not doing you <i>any</i> harm!"</p>

<p>He glanced up from his work, and then, as if on an
irresistible impulse, left the chain to come and stand beside
me, as I sat wrapped up in his gift "for a good girl."</p>

<p>He gazed at me for a moment without speaking, and I
wonderingly returned the gaze, not knowing what was to follow.</p>

<p>The moon had come sailing up like a great silver ship,
over the snow billows, and gleamed against a sky which
was still a garden of full-blown roses not yet faded, though
sunset was long over. The soft, pure light shone on his
dark face, cutting it out clearly, and he had never looked
so handsome.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to do <i>me</i> any harm, do you?" he said.</p>

<p>"I couldn't if I would, and wouldn't if I could," I
answered in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yet you <i>do</i> me harm."</p>

<p>"You're joking!"</p>

<p>"I never was further from joking in my life. You
do me harm because you make me wish for something I
can't have, something it's a constant fight with me, ever
since we've been thrown together, not to wish for, not to
think of. Yet you say I'm cross! Now, do you know
what I mean, and will you help me a little to remain
your faithful brother, instead of tempting me&mdash;tempting
me, however unconsciously, to&mdash;to wish&mdash;for&mdash;for&mdash;what
a fool I am! I'm going to finish my mending."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>I sat perfectly still, with my mouth open, feeling as if
it were <i>my</i> chain, not the car's, which had broken!</p>

<p>Of course if it hadn't been for all his talk of <i>Her</i>, I
should have known, or thought that I knew, well enough
what he meant. But how could I take his strange words
and stammered hints for what they seemed to suggest,
knowing as I did, from his own veiled confessions, that
he was in love with some beautiful fiend who had ruined
his career and then thrown him over!</p>

<p>I longed to speak, to ask him just one question, but I
dared not. No words would come; and perhaps if they
had, I should have regretted them, for I was so sure he
was not a man who would fall out of love with one woman
to tumble into love for another, that I didn't know what
to make of him; but the thought which his words shot
into my mind, swift and keen, and then tore away again,
showed me very well what to make of myself.</p>

<p>If I hadn't quite known before, I knew suddenly, all in
a minute, that I was in love, oh, but humiliatingly deep in
love, with the chauffeur! It seemed to me that no nice,
well-regulated girl could ever have let herself go tobogganing
down such a steep hill, splash into such a sea of love,
unless the man were at the bottom in a boat, holding out
his arms to catch her as she fell. But the chauffeur hadn't
the slightest intention of holding out his arms to the poor
little motor maid. He went on mending the chain, and
when he got into the car beside me again he began to
talk about the weather.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>


<p>It was ten o'clock when we came into Clermont-Ferrand,
which looked a beautiful old place in the
moonlight, with the great, white Puy de Dome
floating half way up the sky, like a marble dream-palace.</p>

<p>I trembled for our reception at the ch&acirc;teau, for everything
would be our fault, from the snow on the mountains
to Lady Turnour's lack of a dinner dress; and the consciousness
of our innocence would be our sole comfort.
Not for an instant did we believe that it would help our
case to stop at the railway station and arrange for the big
luggage to be sent the first thing in the morning; nevertheless,
we satisfied our consciences by doing it, though we
were so hungry that everything uneatable seemed
irrelevant.</p>

<p>A young woman in a book, who had just pried into the
depths of her soul, and discovered there a desperate love,
would have loathed the thought of food; but evidently I
am unworthy to be a heroine, for my imagination called up
visions of soup and steak; and because it seemed so
extremely important to be hungry, I could quite well put
off being unhappy until to-morrow.</p>

<p>It is only three miles from Clermont-Ferrand to the
Ch&acirc;teau de Roquemartine, and we came to it easily, without
inquiries, Jack having carefully studied the road map
with Sir Samuel. He had only to stop at the porter's lodge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>to make sure we were right, and then to teuf-teuf up a long,
straight avenue, sounding our musical siren as an announcement
of our arrival. It was only when I saw
the fine old mansion on a terraced plateau, its creamy
stone white as pearl in the moonlight, its rows upon rows
of windows ablaze, that I remembered my position disagreeably.
I was going to stay at this charming place, as
a servant, not as a member of the house-party. I would
have to eat in the servants' hall&mdash;I, Lys d'Angely, whose
family had been one of the proudest in France. Why,
the name de Roquemartine was as nothing beside ours.
It had not even been invented when ours was already old.
What would my father say if he could see his daughter
arriving thus at a house which would have been too much
honoured by a visit from him? I was suddenly ashamed.
My boasted sense of humour, about which I am usually
such a Pharisee, sulked in a corner and refused to come out
to my rescue, though I called upon it. Funny it might be
to eat in the kitchens of inns, but I could not feel that it was
funny to be relegated to the servants' brigade in the private
house of a countryman of my father.</p>

<p>What queerly complicated creatures we little human
animals are! An avalanche of love hadn't destroyed my
hunger. A knife-thrust in my vanity killed it in an instant;
and I can't believe this was simply because I'm female.
I shouldn't be surprised if a man might feel exactly the
same&mdash;or more so.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" I sighed. "It's going to be horrid here.
But"&mdash;with a stab of remorse for my self-absorption&mdash;"it's
just as bad for you as for me. <i>You</i> don't need to
stay in the house, though. You're a man, and free.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Don't stop for my sake. I won't have it! Please live in
an inn. There's sure to be one near by."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to look for it," said my brother. "You
needn't worry about me. I've got pretty callous. I shall
have quarters for nothing here&mdash;you're always preaching
economy."</p>

<p>But I wouldn't be convinced. "Pooh! You're only
saying that, so that I won't think you're sacrificing yourself
for me. Do you know anything about the Roquemartines?"</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"Good gracious, I hope you've never met them?"</p>

<p>"I believe I lunched here with them once three years
ago, with a motoring friend of theirs."</p>

<p>He stated this fact so quietly, that, if I hadn't begun
to know him and his ways, I might have supposed him
indifferent to the situation; but&mdash;I can hardly say why&mdash;I
didn't suppose it. I supposed just the contrary; and
I respected him, and his calmness, twenty times more than
before, if that were possible. Besides, I would have loved
him twenty times more, only that was impossible. How
much stronger and better he was than I&mdash;I, who blurted
out my every feeling! I, a stranger, felt the position almost
too hateful for endurance, simply because it was ruffling
to my vanity. He, an acquaintance of these people, who
had been their guest, resigned himself to herding with their
servants, because&mdash;yes, I knew it!&mdash;because he would
not let me bear annoyances alone.</p>

<p>"You can't, you <i>shan't</i> stop in the house!" I gasped.
"Leave me and the luggage. Drive the car to the nearest village."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>"I don't <i>want</i> to leave you. Can't you understand
that?" he said. "I'm not sacrificing myself."</p>

<p>We were at the door. We had been heard. If I had
suddenly been endowed with the eloquence of Demosthenes,
the gift would have come too late. The door was
thrown open, not by servants, but by a merry, curious
crowd of ladies and gentlemen, anxious to see the arrival
of the belated, no doubt much talked of, automobile.
Light streamed out from a great hall, which seemed, at
first glance, to be half full of people in evening dress, girls
and young men, gay and laughing. Everybody was talking
at the same time, chattering both English and French,
nobody listening to anybody else, all intent on having a
glimpse of the car. I believe they were disappointed not
to see it battered by some accident; sensations are so dear
to the hearts of idle ones.</p>

<p>Sir Samuel Turnour came out, with two young men and
a couple of girls, while Lady Turnour, afraid of the cold,
remained on the threshold in a group of other women
among whom she was violently conspicuous by the blazing
of her jewels. The others were all in dinner dress, with
very few jewels. She had attempted to atone for her
blouse and short skirt by putting on all her diamonds and
a rope or two of pearls. Poor woman! I knew her
capable of much. I had not supposed her capable of this.</p>

<p>Instinct told me that one of the young men with Sir
Samuel was the Marquis de Roquemartine, and I trembled
with physical dread, as if under a lifted lash, of his greeting
to Jack. But the <i>pince-nez</i> over prominent, near-sighted
eyes, gave me hope that my chauffeur might be spared an
unpleasant ordeal. Joy! the Marquis did not appear to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>recognize him, and neither did the Marquise, if she were
one of the young women who had run out to the car.
Maybe, if he could escape recognition now, he might escape
altogether. Once swept away among the flotsam and
jetsam below stairs, he would be both out of sight and out
of mind. I did not care about myself now, only for him,
and I was beginning to cheer up a little, when I noticed
that the other young man was gazing at the chauffeur very intently.</p>

<p>His flushed face, and small fair moustache, his
light eyes and hair, looked as English as the Marquis'
short, pointed chestnut beard and sleek hair <i>en brosse</i>,
looked French. "Bertie!" I said to myself, flashing a
glance at him from under my veil.</p>

<p>Bertie, if Bertie it was, did not speak. He simply stared,
mechanically pulling an end of his tiny moustache, while
Sir Samuel talked. But he was so much interested in his
stepfather's chauffeur that when the really very pretty girl
near him spoke, over his shoulder, he did not hear.</p>

<p>"Well, we began to think you'd tumbled over a precipice!"
exclaimed Sir Samuel, with the jovial loudness that
comes to men of his age from good champagne or the rich
red wines of Southern France.</p>

<p>Jack explained. The fair-haired young man let him
finish in peace, and then said, slowly, "Isn't your name Dane?"</p>

<p>"It is," replied my brother.</p>

<p>"Thought I knew your face," went on the other. "So
you've taken to chauffeuring as a last resort&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>He was intended by Providence to be good looking, but
so snobbish was his expression as he spoke, so cruelly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>sarcastic his voice, that he became hideous in my eyes.
A bleached skull grinning over a tall collar could not
have seemed more repulsive than the pink, healthy features
of that young man with his single eye-glass and his sneer.</p>

<p>Jack paid no more attention than if he had not heard, but
the slight stiffening of his face and raising of his eyebrows
as he turned to Sir Samuel, made him look supremely
proud and distinguished, incomparably more a gentleman
in his dusty leather livery, than Bertie in his well-cut
evening clothes.</p>

<p>"I called at the railway station, and the luggage will be
here before eight to-morrow morning," he said, quietly.</p>

<p>"All right, all right," replied Sir Samuel, slow to understand
what was going on, but uncomfortable between the
two young men. "I didn't know that you were acquainted
with my stepson, Dane."</p>

<p>"It was scarcely an acquaintance, sir," said the chauffeur.
"And I wasn't aware that Mr. Stokes was your stepson."</p>

<p>"If you had been, you jolly well wouldn't have taken the
engagement&mdash;what?" remarked Bertie, with a hateful laugh.</p>

<p>This time Jack condescended to look at him; from the
head down, from the feet up. "Really," he said, after
an instant's reflection, "it wouldn't have been fair to Sir
Samuel to feel a prejudice on account of the relationship.
If one of the servants would kindly show me the garage&mdash;"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>


<p>If it hadn't been for the hope of seeing Jack again,
I should have said that I wanted nothing to eat,
when I was asked; but I thought that he might
come to the servants' dining-room, if only because he
would expect to find me there; and I was right: he came.</p>

<p>"What an imbroglio!" I whispered, as he joined me
at the table, where hot soup and cold chicken were set forth.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said he, cheerfully. "Things are better
for me than I thought. Roquemartine didn't recognize
me, I'm sure, for if he had, he would have said so. He
isn't a snob. But I rather hoped he would have forgotten.
I came as a stranger, brought by a friend of his and mine,
was here only for a meal (we were motoring then, too)&mdash;and
it's three years ago."</p>

<p>"But the marquise?"</p>

<p>"She's a bran new one. I fancied I'd heard that the
wife died. This one has the air of a bride, and I should
say she's an American."</p>

<p>"Yes. She is. The maid who showed me my room
told me. The other girl who came out of doors, is her
sister. They're fearfully rich, it seems, and that young
brute wants to marry her."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the descriptive adjective, my little
partizan, but you're troubling yourself for me more than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>you need. I don't mind, really. It's all in a life-time,
and I knew when I went in for this business, that I should
have to take the rough with the smooth. I was down
on my luck, and glad to get anything. What I have got
is honest, and something that I know I can do well&mdash;something
I enjoy, too; and I'm not going to let a vulgar
young snob like that make me ashamed of myself, when
I've nothing to be ashamed of."</p>

<p>"You ought to be proud of yourself, not ashamed!"
I cried to him, trying to keep my eyes cold.</p>

<p>"Heaven knows there's little enough to be proud of.
You'd see that, if I bored you with my history&mdash;and
perhaps I will some day. But anyhow, I've nothing
which I need to hide."</p>

<p>"As if I didn't know that! But Bertie hates you."</p>

<p>"I don't much blame him for that. In a way, the
position in which we stand to each other is a kind
of poetical justice. I don't blame myself, either, for I
always did loathe a cad and Stokes is a cad par excellence.
He visited, more or less on suffrance, at two or three
houses where I used to go a good deal, in my palmy days.
How he got asked, originally, I don't exactly know, for
the people weren't a bit his sort; but money does a lot
for a man in these days; and once in, he wasn't easy to
get rid of. He had a crawling way with any one he
hoped to squeeze any advantage out of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose he crawled to you then," I broke in.</p>

<p>"He did try it on, a bit, because I knew people he
wanted to know; but it didn't work. I rather put myself
out to be rude to him, for I resented a fellow like that
worming himself into places where he had no earthly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>right to be&mdash;no right of brains, or heart, or breeding. I
must admit, now I think of it, that he has several scores
to wipe off; and judging from the way he begins, he
will wipe hard. Let him!"</p>

<p>"No, no," I protested. "You mustn't let him. It's
too much. You will have to tell Sir Samuel that he must
find a new chauffeur at once. It hurts me like a blow
to think of such a creature humiliating you. I couldn't
see it done."</p>

<p>He looked at me very kindly, with quite all a brother's
tenderness. "My dear little pal," he said, "you won't
have to see it."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;you will go?" Of course, I wanted
him to take my advice, or I wouldn't have offered it, yet
it gave me a heartache to think he was ready to take it so easily.</p>

<p>"I mean that I'm not the man to let myself be humiliated
by a Bertie Stokes. Possibly he may persuade his
stepfather to sack me, but I don't think he'll succeed
in doing that, even if he tries. Sir Samuel, I suppose,
has given him every thing he has; sent him to Oxford
(I know he was there, and scraped through by the skin
of his teeth), and allows him thousands enough to mix
with a set where he doesn't belong; but though the old
boy is weak in some ways, he has a strong sense of justice,
and where he likes he is loyal. I think he does like me,
and I don't believe he'd discharge me to please his stepson.
Not only that, I should be surprised if the promising
Bertie wanted me discharged. It would be more in his
line to want me kept on, so that he might take it out of me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>I shuddered; but Jack smiled, showing his white teeth
almost merrily. "You may see some fun," he said, "but
it shan't be death to the frogs; not so bad as that. And
I shall have you to be kind to me."</p>

<p>"Kind to you!" I echoed, rather tremulously. (If
he only knew how kind I should like to be!) "Yes, I
will be kind. But I can't do anything to make up for what
you'll have to bear. You had better go."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I would, if I could take you away with me,
but that can't be. And, no, even in that case, I should
prefer to stick it out. I shouldn't like to let that young
bounder drive me from a place, whether I wanted to go
or not. And do you think I would clear out, and leave
him to worry you?"</p>

<p>"He can't," I said.</p>

<p>"I wish I were sure of that. When the beast sees
you without your veil&mdash;oh, hang it, you mustn't let
him come near you, you know."</p>

<p>"He isn't likely to take the slightest notice of his stepfather's
wife's maid," said I, "especially as he's dying
to marry the American heiress here."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, be careful."</p>

<p>"I shan't look at him if I can help it. And we shall
be gone before long. I believe the Turnours' invitation,
which their Bertie was bribed to ask for, is only for two
or three days. How you <i>must</i> have been feeling when
you were told to drive here! But you showed nothing."</p>

<p>"I had a qualm or two when I was sure of the place;
but then it was over. It's far worse for you than for me.
And I told you I've been learning from you a lesson of
cheerfulness. I was merely a Stoic before."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>"It's nothing for me, comparatively," I said, and by
this time, I was quite sincere; but I didn't know then
what the next twenty-four hours were to bring.</p>

<p>We were not left alone for long, but in ten minutes
we had had our talk out, while we played at eating the
meal we had looked forward to with eagerness before our
appetites were crowded into the background. A fat
<i>sous chef</i> flitted about; maids and valets glanced in;
nevertheless, we found time for a heart-warming hand
pressure before we parted for the night. Altogether, I
had not had more than fifteen minutes in the dining-room;
yet when I left I felt a hundred times braver and
more cheerful.</p>

<p>Already I had been to my mistress's quarters. The maid
who took charge of me on my arrival showed me that room
before she showed me mine, and explained the way from
one to the other. My "bump of locality" was tested,
however, in getting back to her ladyship's part of the
house, for the castle has its intricacies.</p>

<p>The word "ch&acirc;teau," in France, covers a multitude of
comfortable, unpretentious family mansions, as I had not
to find out now, for the first time; and the dwelling of the
Roquemartines, though a fine old house of the seventeenth
century, is no more imposing, under its high, slate roof,
than many another. It is Lady Turnour's first experience,
though, as a visitor in the "mansions of the great," and
when I had been briskly unpacking for half an hour or so,
she came in, somewhat subdued by her new emotions.
I think that she was rather glad to see a familiar face, to
have someone to talk to of whom she did not feel in awe,
with whom she need not be afraid of making some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>mistake; and she seemed quite human to me, for the first time.</p>

<p>Never had I seen her in such an expansive mood, not
even when she gave me the blouse. Instead of the cross
words I had braced myself to expect, she was almost
friendly. She had felt a fool, she said, not being able
to dress for dinner, but then no one else could touch
her, for jewels; and didn't every one just stare, at the
table, though, of course, she hadn't put on her tiara,
as that wouldn't have been suitable with a blouse
and short skirt! Sir Samuel's stepson had been quite
nasty and superior about the jewels, when he got at her,
afterward, and she believed would have been rude if
he'd dared, but luckily he didn't know her well enough
for that; and he'd better be careful how far he went,
or he'd find things very different from what they'd
been with him, since his mother married Sir Samuel.
As if men knew when women ought to wear their jewels,
and when not! But he was green with jealousy of the
things his stepfather had given her; wanted everything himself.</p>

<p>She went on to describe the other members of the house
party, and mouthed their titles with delight, though she
had only her own maid to impress. Everyone had a
title, it seemed, except Bertie, and the American girl he
wanted to marry, Miss Nelson, a sister of the young
marquise. Some of the titles were very high ones, too.
There were princes and princesses, and dukes and duchesses
all over the place, mostly French and Italian, though
one of the duchesses was American, like the marquise
and her sister.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>"Not the Duchesse de Melun!" I exclaimed, before I stopped to think.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the name," said her ladyship, twisting
round to look up at me, as I wound her back hair in
curling-pins. "What do you know about her?"</p>

<p>How I wished that I knew nothing&mdash;and that I hadn't spoken!</p>

<p>The name had popped out, because the Duchesse de
Melun is the only American-born duchess of my acquaintance,
and because I was hoping very hard that the duchess
of the Ch&acirc;teau de Roquemartine might <i>not</i> be the Duchesse
de Melun. What bad luck that the Roquemartines had
selected that particular duchess for this particular house
party, when they must know plenty, and could just as
well have chosen another specimen!</p>

<p>"I have heard her name," I admitted, primly. And
so I had, too often. "A friend of mine was&mdash;was with
her, once."</p>

<p>"As her maid?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly."</p>

<p>"Another sort of servant, I suppose?"</p>

<p>As her ladyship stated this as a fact, rather than asked
it as a question, I ventured to refrain from answering.
Fortunately she didn't notice the omission, as her thoughts
had jumped to another subject. But mine were not so
readily displaced. They remained fastened to the
Duchesse de Melun; and while Lady Turnour talked, I
was wondering whether I could successfully contrive to
keep out of the duchess's way. She is quite intimate
with Cousin Catherine; and I told myself that she was
pretty sure already to have heard the truth about my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>disappearance. Or, if even with her friends, Cousin
Catherine clings to conventionalities, and pretends that
I'm visiting somewhere by her consent, people are almost
certain to scent a mystery, for mysteries are popular.
"If that duchess woman sees me, she'll write to Cousin
Catherine at once," I thought. "Or I wouldn't put it
<i>past</i> her to telegraph!"</p>

<p>("Put it past" is an expression of Cousin Catherine's
own, which I always disliked; but it came in handy now.)</p>

<p>I tried to console myself, though, by reflecting that, if
I were careful, I ought to be able to avoid the duchess.
The ways of great ladies and little maids lie far apart in
grand houses and&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is going to be a servants' ball to-morrow night,"
announced Lady Turnour, while my thoughts struggled
out of the slough of despond. "And I want you to be the
best dressed one there, for <i>my</i> credit. We're all going to
look on, and some of the young gentlemen may dance.
The marquise and Miss Nelson say they mean to, too, but
I should think they are joking. <i>I</i> may not be a French
princess nor yet a marquise, but I <i>am</i> an English lady,
and I must say I shouldn't care to dance with my cook,
or my chauffeur."</p>

<p>Her chauffeur would be at one with her there! But I
could think of nothing save myself in this crisis. "Oh,
miladi, I <i>can't</i> go to a servants' ball!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>She bridled. "Why not, I should like to know? Do
you consider yourself above it?"</p>

<p>"It isn't that," I faltered. (And it wasn't; it was
that duchess!) "But&mdash;but&mdash;" I searched for an
excuse. "I haven't anything to wear."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>"I will see to that," said my mistress, with relentless
generosity. "I intend to give you a dress, and as you have
next to nothing to do to-morrow, you can alter it in time.
If you had any gratitude in you, Elise, you'd be out of
yourself with joy at the idea."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am out of myself, miladi," I moaned.</p>

<p>"Well, you might say 'Thank your ladyship,' then."</p>

<p>I said it.</p>

<p>"When you have unpacked the big luggage in the
morning, I will give you the dress. I have decided on it
already. Sir Samuel doesn't like it on me, so I don't
mind parting with it; but it's very handsome, and cost me
a great deal of money when I was getting my trousseau. It
is scarlet satin trimmed with green beetle-wing passementerie,
and gold fringe."</p>

<p>My one comfort, as I gasped out spasmodic thanks, was
this: I would look such a vulgar horror in the scarlet satin
trimmed with green beetle-wings and gold fringe, that the
Duchesse de Melun might fail to recognize Lys d'Angely.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>


<p>I dusted and shook out every cell in my brain,
during the night, in the hope of finding any inspiration
which might save me from the servants' ball;
but I could think of nothing, except that I might suddenly
come down with a contagious disease. The objection to
this scheme was that a doctor would no doubt be sent
for, and would read my secret in my lack of temperature.</p>

<p>When morning came, I was sullenly resigned to the
worst. "Kismet!" said I, as I unfolded her ladyship's
dresses, and was blinded by the glare of the scarlet satin.</p>

<p>"Try it on," commanded my mistress. "I want to get
an idea how you will look."</p>

<p>Naturally, the red thing was a Directoire thing; and
putting it on over my snug little black frock, I was like a
cricket crawling into an empty lobster-shell. But to my
surprise and annoyance, the lobster-shell was actually
becoming to the cricket.</p>

<p>I didn't want to look nice and be a credit to Lady Turnour.
I wanted to look a fright, and didn't care if I were
a disgrace to her. But the startling scarlet satin was
Liberty satin, and therefore had a sheen, and a soft way
of folding that redeemed it somewhat. Its bright poppy
colour, its emerald beetle-wings shading to gold, and its
glittering fringes that waved like a wheat-field stirred by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>a breeze, all gave a bizarre sort of "value," as artists say,
to my pale yellow hair and dark eyes. I couldn't help
seeing that the dreadful dress made my skin pearly
white; and I was afraid that, when I had altered the
thing, instead of looking like a frump, I should only present
the appearance of a rather fast little actress. I should be
looked at in my scarlet abomination. People would stare,
and smile. The Duchesse de Melun would say to the
Marquise de Roquemartine: "Who is that young person?
She looks exactly like someone I know&mdash;that little Lys
d'Angely the millionaire-man, Charretier, is so silly about."</p>

<p>"You see, you can alter it very easily," said Lady Turnour.</p>

<p>"Yes, miladi."</p>

<p>"Have you got any dancing slippers?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;that is&mdash;I don't know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be stupid. I will give you ten francs to buy
yourself a pair of red stockings and red slippers to match.
The stockings needn't be silk. They won't show much.
Dane can take you in the car to Clermont-Ferrand this
afternoon. I want you to be all right, from head to feet&mdash;different
from any of the other maids."</p>

<p>I didn't doubt that I would be different&mdash;very different.</p>

<p>Tap, tap, a knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Ontray!" cried her ladyship.</p>

<p>The door opened. Mr. Herbert Stokes stood on the threshold.</p>

<p>"I say, Lady T&mdash;" he began, when he saw the scarlet vision, and stopped.</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquired the wife of his stepfather&mdash;rather a
complicated relation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>"I&mdash;er&mdash;wanted&mdash;" drawled Bertie. "But it doesn't matter. Another time."</p>

<p>"You needn't mind <i>her</i>," said Lady Turnour, with a
nod toward me. "It's only my maid. I'm giving her
a dress for the servants' ball to-night."</p>

<p>Bertie gave vent to the ghost of a whistle, below his
breath. He looked at me, twisting the end of his small fair
moustache, as he had looked at Jack Dane last night; and
though his expression was different, I liked it no better.</p>

<p>"Thought it was a new guest," said he.</p>

<p>"I suppose you didn't take her for a lady, did you?"
my mistress was curious to know. "You pride yourself
on your discrimination, your stepfather says."</p>

<p>"There's nothing the matter with my discrimination,"
replied the young man, smiling. But his smile was not
for her ladyship. It was for me; and it was meant to be
a piquant little secret between us two.</p>

<p>How well I remembered asking the chauffeur, "<i>Could</i>
you know a Bertie?" And how he answered that he had
known one, and consequently didn't want to know
another. Here was the same Bertie; and now that I too
knew him, I thought I would prefer to know another,
rather than know more of him. Yet he was good-looking,
almost handsome. He had short, curly light hair, eyes as
blue as turquoises, seen by daylight, full red lips under
the little moustache, a white forehead, a dimple in the
chin, and a very good figure. He had also an educated,
perhaps too well educated, voice, which tried to advertise
that it had been made at Oxford; and he had hands as
carefully kept as a pretty woman's, with manicured,
filbert-shaped nails.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>"You're making her jolly smart," he went on. "She'll
do you credit."</p>

<p>"I want she should," retorted her ladyship, gratified
and ungrammatical.</p>

<p>"She must give me a dance&mdash;what?" condescended the
gilded youth. "Does she speak English?"</p>

<p>"Yes. So you'd better be careful what you say before her."</p>

<p>Bertie telegraphed another smile to me. I looked at the
faded damask curtains; at the mantelpiece with its gilded
clock and two side-pieces, Louis Seize at his worst, considered
good enough for a bedroom; at the drapings of
the enormous bed; at the porti&egrave;re covering the door of
Sir Samuel's dressing-room; at the kaleidoscopic claret-and-blue
figures on the carpet; in fact, at everything within
reach of my eyes except Mr. Herbert Stokes.</p>

<p>"I've nothing to say that she can't hear," said he,
virtuously. "I only wanted to know if you'd like to see
the gardens? The marquise sent me to ask. Several
people who haven't been here before are goin'. It's a
lot warmer this mornin', so you won't freeze."</p>

<p>Lady Turnour said that she would go, and ordered me to
find her hat and coat. As I turned to get them, Bertie
smiled at me again, and threw me a last glance as he
followed my mistress out of the room.</p>

<p>I begin to be afraid there is an innate vanity in me
which nothing can thoroughly eradicate without tearing
me up by the roots; for when I was ready to alter that red
dress, instead of trying to make it look as ridiculous as
possible, something forced me to do my best, to study
fitness and becomingness. I do hope this is self-respect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>and not vanity; but to hope that is, I fear, like believing
in a thing which you know isn't true.</p>

<p>I worked all the morning at ensmalling the gown (if one
can enlarge, why can't one ensmall?) and by luncheon time
it was finished. I had seen Jack at breakfast, but had no
chance for a word with him alone, although he succeeded
valiantly in keeping other chauffeurs, and valets, from
making my acquaintance. As I stopped only long enough
for a cup of coffee and a roll, I didn't give him too much
trouble; but at luncheon it was different. Everyone was
chattering about the ball in the evening (a privilege
promised, it seemed, as a reward for hard work on the
occasion of a real ball above stairs), and house servants
and visitors alike were all so gay and good-natured that it
would have been stupid to snub them. Jack saw this, and
though he protected me as well as he could in an unobtrusive
way, he put out no bristles.</p>

<p>The general excitement was contagious, and if it hadn't
been for the panic I was in about the duchess, I should have
thrown myself wholly into the spirit of the hive, buzzing
like the busiest bee in it. Even as it was, I couldn't help
entering into the fun of the thing, for it was fun in its queer
way. Something like being on the stage of a third-rate
theatre in the midst of a farce, where the actors mistake
you for one of themselves, calling upon you to play your
part, while you alone know that you are a leading member
of the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise, just dropped in at this funny
place to look on.</p>

<p>Here, the stage was on a much grander scale, and the
play more amusing than in the couriers' dining-rooms at
the hotels where I had been. At the hotels, the maids
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>and valets scarcely knew each other. Some were in a
hurry, others were tired or in a bad humour. Here the
little company had been together for days. Meals were a
relaxation, a time for flirtation and gossip about their own
and each other's masters and mistresses. Each servant
felt the liveliest interest in the "Monsieur" or "Madame"
of his or her neighbour; and the stories that were
exchanged, the criticisms that were made, would have
caused the hair of those <i>messieurs</i> and those <i>mesdames</i>
to curl.</p>

<p>If I was openly approved by the gentlemen's gentlemen,
Mr. Jack Dane had the undisguised admiration of the
ladies' ladies; and he received their advances with tact.
Dances for the evening were asked for and promised right
and left, among the assemblage, always dependent upon
summons from Above. It was agreed that, if a Monsieur
or Madame wished to dance with you, no previous
engagement was to stand, for all the castles and big houses
from far and near would be emptied in honour of the ball,
from drawing-rooms to servants' halls, and quality was to
mingle with quantity, as on similar occasions in England,
whence&mdash;the chef explained&mdash;came the fashion. It
was a feature of <i>l'entente cordiale</i>, and the same agreeable
understanding was to level all barriers, for the night,
between high and low.</p>

<p>Some of the visitors' <i>femmes de chambres</i> were pretty,
coquettish creatures, and I was delighted to find that they
were all called by their mistresses' titles. The maid of
my <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> was "Duchesse"; she who pertained to our
hostess was "Marquise," and I blossomed into "Miladi."
The girls were looking forward to rivalling their mistresses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>in <i>chic</i>, and also in the admiration of the real princes and
dukes and counts; that they would have an exclusive
right to the attentions of these gentlemen's understudies
also seemed to be expected.</p>

<p>After half an hour at table in the servants' hall, there was
nothing left for me to find out about the owners of the
castle and their guests; but the principal interest of everyone
seemed to centre upon the affair between Mr. Herbert
Stokes and the heiress sister of Madame la Marquise.
There were even bets among the valets as to how it was to
end, and Bertie's man, who looked as if he could speak
volumes if he would, was a person of importance.</p>

<p>All the men admired Miss Nelson extremely, but the
women were divided in opinion. Her own maid, a bilious
Frenchwoman, with a jealous eye, said that the American
miss was <i>une petite chatte</i>, who was playing off Mr. Stokes
against the Duc de Divonne, and it was a pity that the
handsome young English monsieur could not be warned
of her unworthiness. The duke was not handsome,
and he was neither young nor rich, but&mdash;these Americans
were out for titles, just as titles were out for American
money. Why else had the marriage of Madame la
Marquise, Miss Daisy's elder sister, made itself? Miss
Daisy liked Mr. Stokes, but he could not give her a title.
The duke could&mdash;<i>if</i> he would. But would he? She was
rich, but there were others richer. People said that he
was wary. Yet he admired Miss Daisy, it was true, and
if by her flirtation with Mr. Stokes she could pique him
into a proposal, she would have her triumph.</p>

<p>This was only one of many dramas going on in the
house, but it was the most interesting to me, as to others,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>and I determined to look with all my might at the duke
and at pretty Miss Nelson, of whom I had only had a
glimpse on arriving. If she were really nice, I did hope
that Bertie wouldn't get her!</p>

<p>My costume pressed as weightily on her ladyship's
mind, as if I had been a favourite poodle about to be sent,
all ribboned and clipped, to a dog show. She did not
forget the slippers and stockings, and the chauffeur was
ordered to take me into Clermont-Ferrand to buy them.
Fortunately she didn't know how much I looked forward
to the excursion!</p>

<p>At precisely three o'clock I walked out to the castle
garage, near the stables, and found Jack getting the car
ready; but I did not find him alone. The garage is a big
and splendid one, and not only were the three household
dragons in their stalls, but four or five strange beasts, pets
of visitors; and the finest of these (after our blue Aigle)
was the white Majestic of the Duc de Divonne. That
gentleman, whom I recognized easily from a description
breathed into my ear by a countess's countess, at luncheon,
was in the garage when I arrived, showing off his
automobile to Miss Nelson. The ducal chauffeur lurked
in the background, duster in hand, and Mr. Herbert Stokes
occupied as large a space as possible in the foreground.</p>

<p>Nobody deigned to take any open notice of me, though
Bertie threw me a stealthy smile of recognition, carefully
screened from Miss Nelson, but as the Aigle was swallowing
a last refreshing draught of petrol, I had time to observe
the actors in the little drama whose plot I had already heard.</p>

<p>Yes, though Miss Daisy Nelson looked even prettier
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>than I thought her last night, I could quite believe the
bilious maid's statement that she was <i>une petite chatte</i>.
Her green-gray eyes, very effective under thick masses of
auburn hair, were turned up at the outer corners in a fascinating,
sly little way; and her cupid-bow lips, which turned
down at <i>their</i> corners, were a bit redder than Nature's
formula ordains. Nevertheless I couldn't help liking her,
just as one likes a lovely, playful Persian kitten which may
rub its adorable nose against your hand, or scratch with
its naughty claws. And she was enjoying herself so much,
the pretty, expensive-looking creature! As Pamela would
say, it was evident that she was "having the time of her
life," revelling in the admiration and rivalry of the two
men; delighted with her own power over them, and her
importance as a beauty and an heiress, the only unmarried
girl in the house party; amusing herself by making one
man miserable and the other happy, sending them up and
down on a mental sea-saw, by turns.</p>

<p>As for the little Duc de Divonne, his profile is of the
Roman Emperor order, and his eyes like the last coals
in a dying fire. I said to myself that, if Miss Nelson
should become a duchess, she would have to pay for some
of her girlish antics in pre-duchess days. Still, I decided
that if I had to choose, it would be the duke before Bertie.</p>

<p>The girl kept both her men busy, and after the first
glance Bertie ignored my existence: but the Duke, fired
by a moment's neglect, flamed out with an inspiration.
He "dared" Miss Nelson to take a lesson from him in
driving his car, with no other chaperon than the chauffeur.
"All right, I will," said she, "and I bet you I'll be
an expert after one trial."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>"What do you bet?" asked the Duke.</p>

<p>She smiled flirtatiously in answer and Bertie stood forlorn,
his nice pink complexion turning an ugly salmon
colour. In a minute the white car was off, Miss Nelson
beside the duke, the chauffeur like a small nut in a large
shell, lolling in the tonneau. Bertie turned to us, and
having looked kindly at me, sharply demanded of Jack
where he was going.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle has an errand."</p>

<p>"Ah! then I'll drive Mademoiselle. Wish I had a
tenner for every time I've driven an Aigle! You can sit
inside, in case there's work to do."</p>

<p>My eyes opened widely, but I said nothing. I glanced
at Jack, and saw his face harden.</p>

<p>"I have been told to drive the car, and it is my duty to
drive it unless I receive different orders," said he.</p>

<p>"I'm giving you different orders," said Bertie.</p>

<p>"I take my orders only from the owner of the car."</p>

<p>"You're beastly impertinent," snapped Bertie, "and
I'll report you to Sir Samuel."</p>

<p>"As you choose," returned Jack, turning the starting-handle.</p>

<p>"Why don't you say 'sir' when you speak to me? You
don't seem to have trained into chauffeur manners yet."</p>

<p>"If I were your chauffeur, you would have the
right to criticize. As I'm not, and never will be,
you haven't. Mademoiselle, the car's ready. Will you get in?"</p>

<p>I jumped into my usual place, beside the driver's seat.</p>

<p>"Ah, you sit by the chauffeur, do you?" said Bertie.
"I don't wonder he wants to keep his job."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>For an instant I was afraid that Jack would strike him.</p>

<p>My blood rushed to my head, and I half rose from the
seat, with a choked, warning whisper of "Jack!"</p>

<p>It was the first time I'd called him that, except to myself,
and I saw him give the faintest start. He looked at the
other man, and then, though Bertie stepped quickly forward
as if to open the car door and jump in, he sprang to
his place, and we were off.</p>

<p>"He means mischief," I said, when I felt able to speak.</p>

<p>"So do I, if he does," answered Jack.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd do me a favour," I went on. "Keep
away from that awful ball to-night."</p>

<p>"What! With you there? I know my business better."</p>

<p>I couldn't help laughing. "Your present business, I
believe," said I, "is that of a chauffeur."</p>

<p>"With extra duty as watch-dog."</p>

<p>"I can't bear to have you see me in the ridiculous get-up
Lady Turnour is making me wear, that's the selfish part of
my reason&mdash;and&mdash;and it will be so <i>horrid</i> for you, in
every way."</p>

<p>"I'm callous to anything they can do now, except one thing."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"If you don't know already, I mean where you're concerned."</p>

<p>"You're very kind to me."</p>

<p>"Kind? Yes, I am very 'kind.' A man has to be
abnormally 'kind' to want to look after a girl like you."</p>

<p>"How bitterly you speak!" I exclaimed, hardly understanding him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>"I feel bitter sometimes. Do you wonder? But for
heaven's sake, don't let's talk of me. Let's talk of something
pleasant. Would you care to do a little sight-seeing
in Clermont-Ferrand, if your shopping doesn't take us too long?"</p>

<p>I assured him that it would not take ten minutes; and
it didn't take more. I saved a franc on the transaction,
too, which would console her ladyship if I got back a few
minutes late; and with that thought in my mind, I
abandoned myself to the joy of the expedition. We
went to the Petrifying Fountain, and inspected its strange
menagerie of stone animals; we made a dash into the
Cathedral where St. Louis was married, and looked at the
beautiful thirteenth-century glass in the windows, and the
strange frescoes; we rushed in and out of Notre Dame du
Port, stopping on the way in the <i>Place</i> where the first
Crusade was proclaimed, and to gaze at the house and
statue of Pascal. Jack would squander some of his
extremely hard earned money on a box of the burnt
almonds for which Clermont-Ferrand is celebrated; and
when we had seen everything I dared stop to see, he ran
the car to Montferrand, to show me some ancient and
wonderful houses, famous all over France. Eventually he
threatened to spin me out to Royat, but I pleaded the
certainty that Lady Turnour would wish to change into
her smartest tea-gown for "feef oclocky" and that I must
be there to assist at the ceremony.</p>

<p>So we turned castleward, with all the speed the law
allows, if not a little more; and I arrived with a pair of red
stockings, cheap high-heeled slippers, a franc in change,
and a queer presentiment of dangerous things to happen.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>


<p>Although a good many neighbours were coming
to the Ch&acirc;teau de Roquemartine to look on at
the servants' ball, they were all to drive or motor
over in their ordinary dinner dress; it was only the
servants themselves who were to "make toilettes."</p>

<p>Lady Turnour, however, who regretted having missed
the smart ball for the great world, given a few nights before,
determined that people should be forced to appreciate
her wealth and position; and the wardrobe of Solomon
in all his glory could hardly have produced anything to
exceed her gold tissue, diamant&eacute;.</p>

<p>When I had squeezed, and poked, and pushed her into
it, and was bejewelling her, Sir Samuel came, as usual,
to have his white cravat tied by me. Bertie, too, appeared,
dressed for dinner, and watched me with silent amusement
as I performed my evening duty for his stepfather.</p>

<p>"Pretty gorgeous, aren't you?" he remarked to Lady
Turnour; but she was flattered rather than annoyed by
the criticism, and sailed away good-natured, leaving me
to gather up the few jewels of her collection which she
had discarded. Lately I had been trusted with her
treasures, and felt the responsibility disagreeably, especially
as my mistress&mdash;when she remembered it&mdash;counted
everything ostentatiously over, after relieving
me of my charge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>To-night I had just begun picking up the brooches,
bracelets, diamond stars, coronets and bursting suns
which illuminated the dressing-table firmament, when
Bertie walked in again, through the door that he had
left ajar.</p>

<p>"I came back because my necktie's a failure," said he.
"My man must be in love, I should think. Probably
with you! Anyhow, something's the matter; his fingers
are all thumbs. But you turned out my old governor
rippin'ly. You'll do me, won't you?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he untied his cravat, and produced another.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," I said. "I don't know how to do <i>that</i>
kind of tie."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what?" he stared. "It's just the same as
the governor's&mdash;only a little better. Come along,
there's a dear." He had pushed the door to; now he shut it.</p>

<p>I walked to the other end of the room, and began folding
a blouse. "You'd better give your valet another
trial," I said. "I'm <i>not</i> a valet. I'm Lady Turnour's
maid."</p>

<p>"She's in luck to get you."</p>

<p>"I'm engaged to wait upon <i>her</i>."</p>

<p>"You are stiff! You do the governor's tie."</p>

<p>"Sir Samuel's very kind to me."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be kind, too. I'd like nothing better.
I'll be a lot kinder than he'd dare to be. I say, I've
got a present for you&mdash;something rippin', that you'll
like. You can wear it at the ball to-night, but you'd
better not tell anyone who gave it to you&mdash;what? You
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>shall have it for tyin' my necktie. Now, don't you call
that 'kind'?"</p>

<p>I stopped folding the blouse, and increased my height
by at least an inch. "No," I said, "I call it impertinent,
and I shall be obliged if you will leave Lady Turnour's
room. That's the only thing you can do for me."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Bertie. "What theatre were you at
before you took to lady's maidin'?"</p>

<p>To this I deigned no answer.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, you're a rippin' little actress."</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"And a pretty girl. As pretty as they make 'em."</p>

<p>I invented a new kind of sigh, a cross between a snarl
and a moan.</p>

<p>"Tell me, what's the mystery? There is a mystery
about you, you know. Not a bit of good tryin' to deceive
me.... You might as well own up. I can keep a
secret as well as the next one."</p>

<p>A tapping of my foot. A slamming of a wardrobe
door, which was able to squeak furiously without loss of dignity.</p>

<p>"What <i>were</i> you before my lady took you on?...
Look here, if you don't answer, I shall begin to think
the secret's got to do with <i>those</i>." And he pointed to
the dressing table, where the jewels still lay. He even
put out his hand and took up the bursting sun. (How
I sympathized with it for bursting!) "Worth somethin'&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"You can think whatever you like," I flashed at him,
"if only you'll go out of this room."</p>

<p>"Pity your chauffeur isn't at hand for you to run
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>to," Bertie half sneered, half laughed, for he was keeping
his hateful, teasing good nature. "And by the way,
talkin' of him, since you're such a little prude, I'll just
warn you in a friendly way to look out for that chap.
You don't know his history&mdash;what? I'm sure the
governor doesn't."</p>

<p>"Sir Samuel knows he can drive, and that he's a <i>gentleman</i>,"
said I, with meaning emphasis.</p>

<p>"Well, I've warned you," replied Bertie, injured.
"You may see which one of us is really your friend, before
you're out of this galley. But if you want to be a good
and happy little girl, you'd best be nice to me. I shall
find out all about you, you know."</p>

<p>That was his exit speech; and the only way in which I
could adequately express my opinion of it was to bang the
door on his back.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The ball was in a huge vault of a room which had once
been a granary. The stone floor had been worn smooth
by many feet and several centuries, and the blank gray
walls were brightened with drapery of flags, yards of
coloured cotton, paper flowers and evergreens, arranged
with an effect which none save Latin hands could have
given. Dinner above and below stairs was early, and
before ten the guests began to assemble in the ballroom.
All the servant-world had dined in ball costume, excepting
Jack and myself, and it was only at the last minute that the
cricket hopped upstairs and wriggled into its neatly
reduced lobster shell.</p>

<p>I had visions of my brother lurking gloomily yet observantly
in obscure corners, ready at any moment for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
<i>sortie</i> in my defence; but when I sneaked, sidled, and slid
into the ballroom, making myself as small as possible that
I might pass unobserved in spite of my sensational redness,
I had a surprise. Near the door stood the chauffeur in
evening dress, out-princing and out-duking every prince
and duke among the Marquise de Roquemartine's guests.
And I, who hadn't even known that he possessed evening
clothes, could not have opened my eyes wider if my knight
had appeared in full armour.</p>

<p>I had broken the news of the scarlet dress to him, nevertheless
I saw it was a shock. To each one, the other was
a new person, as we stood and talked together. I said not
a word about my scene with Bertie, for there was trouble
enough between the two already; but when Jack told me
that, if I were asked to dance by anyone objectionable, I
must say I was engaged to him, I knew which One loomed
largest and ugliest in his mind.</p>

<p>A glance round the big, bright room showed me many
strangers. All were servants, however, for the grand people
had not yet come down to play their little game of condescension.
A band from Clermont-Ferrand was making
music, but the ball was to be opened by the marquise and
her guests, who were to honour their servants by dancing
the first dance with them. Each noble lady was to select a
cook, butler, footman, chauffeur, or groom, according to
her pleasure; and each noble lord was to lead out the
female worm which least displeased his eye.</p>

<p>Hardly had I time to dive deep into the wave of domesticity,
when the great moment arrived, and a spray of aristocracy
sprinkled the top of that heavy wave, with the
dazzling sparkle of its jewels and its beauty. Really it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>was a pretty sight! I had to admire it; and in watching
the play of light and colour I forgot my private worries
until I saw Bertie bowing before me.</p>

<p>The marquise had just honoured her own butler. The
marquis was offering his arm to the housekeeper; the Duc
de Divonne had led out Miss Nelson's bilious maid, appalling
in apple-green: Miss Nelson was returning the compliment
by giving her hand to his valet: why should not this
young gentleman dance with his step-mother-in-law's maid?</p>

<p>There seemed no reason why not, except the maid's
disinclination; and sudden side-slip of the brain caused by
the glassy impudence in Mr. Stokes's eye so disturbed my
equilibrium that I forgot Jack's offer. He did not forget,
however&mdash;it would hardly have been Jack, if he had&mdash;but
stepped forward to claim me as I began to stammer
some excuse.</p>

<p>"Oh, come, that isn't playin' the game," said Bertie.
"We're all dancin' with servants this turn. Go ask a
lady, Dane."</p>

<p>"I have asked a lady, and she has promised to dance
with me," said Jack. "Miss d'Angely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the lady's name, is it? I'm glad to know,"
mumbled Bertie, as Jack whisked me away from under
his nose.</p>

<p>"By Jove, I oughtn't to have let that out, ought I?"
said Jack, remorseful. "The less he knows about you, the
better; and as Lady Turnour has no idea of pronunciation,
if it hadn't been for my stupidity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't call it that," I stopped him, as we began to dance.
"It doesn't matter a bit&mdash;unless it should occur to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Duchesse de Melun to ask him questions about me. And
I'd rather not think about that possibility, or anything
else disagreeable, to spoil this heavenly waltz."</p>

<p>"You <i>can</i> dance a little, can't you?" said Jack, in a tone
and with a look that made the words better than any
compliment any other man had ever paid me on my dancing,
though I'd been likened to feathers, and vine-tendrils,
and various poetically airy things.</p>

<p>"You aren't so bad yourself, brother," I retorted, in the
same tone. "Our steps suit, don't they?"</p>

<p>He muttered something, which sounded like "Just a
little better than anything else on earth, that's all"; but
of course it couldn't really have been what my ears tried
to make my vanity believe.</p>

<p>When we stopped&mdash;which we didn't do while there was
music to go on with&mdash;I was conscious that people were
looking at us, and nobody with more interest than the
Duchesse de Melun. I glanced hastily away before my
eye had quite caught hers; but no female thing needs to
give a whole eye to what is going on around her. I knew,
although my back was soon turned in her direction, that
the Duchesse de Melun was talking to Lady Turnour, and
I guessed the subject of the conversation. Thank goodness,
my mistress's mind had never compassed more than
a misleading "Elise," and thank goodness, also, many of
the great folk were preparing to leave us humble ones to
ourselves, now that their condescension had been proved
in the first dance. Would the duchess go? Yes&mdash;oh
joy!&mdash;she gets up from her seat. She moves toward
the door. Lady Turnour has risen too, but sits down
again, lured by the proximity of a princess. All will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>well, perhaps! The duchess mayn't think of catechizing
Bertie, now that my mistress has put her off the track. He,
with several other young men, evidently means to stop and
see the fun out. If only he would sit still, now, beside the
marquise! But no. Miss Nelson and the Duc de
Divonne are going out together. Bertie must needs jump
up and dash across the room for a word with the girl.
Discouraged by some laughing answer flung over her
shoulder, he almost bumps against the duchess. Horror!
She speaks to him quite eagerly. She puts a question.
He replies. She bends her head near to him. They walk
slowly out of the room, talking, talking. All is up with
Lys d'Angely! The next thing that Meddlesome Matty
of a duchess will do, is to wire Cousin Catherine Milvaine.
Crash! thunder&mdash;lightning&mdash;hail!&mdash;Monsieur Charretier
on my track again.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I resolved, as I saw myself lying shattered at my own
feet, to pick up the bits and say nothing to Jack, lest he
should blame his own inadvertent dropping of my name
for all present and future mischief. Being a man, he can
see things only with his eyes; and as he happened to be
looking at me, he missed the pantomime at the other end
of the room. I was looking at him too, but of course that
didn't prevent me from seeing other things; and while I
was chatting with him, and wondering how long it might
be before the thunderbolt (Monsieur Charretier) should
fall, I received another invitation to dance. This time
it was from a delightful old boy who looked sixty and
felt twenty-one.</p>

<p>He was ruddy-brown, with tight gray curls on his head,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>and deep dimples in his cheeks. If anyone had told me
that he was not an English admiral I should have known
it was a fib.</p>

<p>"I hope you aren't engaged for this next waltz?" said
he. "I should like very much to have it with you." And
he spoke as nicely as he would to a young girl of his own
world, although he must have heard from someone that I
was a lady's maid.</p>

<p>I glanced at Jack, but evidently he approved of admirals
as partners for his sister. He kept himself in the background,
smiling benevolently, and I skipped away with my
brown old sailor, as the music for the dance began.</p>

<p>"Heard you spoke English," said he, encircling my
Directoire waist with the arm of a sea-going Hercules,
"otherwise I shouldn't have had the courage to come up
and speak to you."</p>

<p>I laughed. "A Dreadnought afraid of a fishing-smack!"</p>

<p>"My word, if you were a fishin'-smack, my little friend,
you wouldn't lack for fish to catch," chuckled the old
gentleman, who was waltzing like an elderly angel&mdash;as
all sailors do. Now, if Bertie had said what he said, I
should have been offended, but coming from the admiral
it cheered me up.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> an admiral, aren't you?" I was bold enough
to ask.</p>

<p>"Who told you that?" he wanted to know.</p>

<p>"My eyes," said I.</p>

<p>"They're bright ones," he retorted. "But I suppose
I do look an old sea-dog&mdash;what? A regular old salt-water
dog. But by George, it's hot water I've got into
to-night. D'ye see that stout lady we're just passin'?&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>one in the red wig and yellow frock covered with paste
or diamonds?"</p>

<p>(If she could have heard the description! It was Lady
Turnour, in her gold tissue, her Bond Street jewellery shop,
and, my charge, her beautifully undulated, copper-tinted
transformation.)</p>

<p>"Yes, I see her," I said faintly, as we waltzed past; and
I wondered why she was glaring.</p>

<p>"I suppose you didn't notice me doin' the first dance
with her? Well, I asked her because they said we'd all
got to invite servants to begin with, and as the best were
snapped up before I got a chance, I walked over to her
like a man. Give you my word, where all are dressed like
duchesses, I took her for a cook."</p>

<p>I laughed so much that I shook my feet out of time with the music.</p>

<p>"Did you treat her like a cook, too?" I gurgled. "Ask
her to give you her favourite recipe for soup?"</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid, no. I treated her like a countess.
One would a cook, you know. It was afterward I got
into the hot water. I popped her down in a seat when
we'd scrambled through a turn or two of the dance, and
that was all right; but instead of stoppin' where she was
put, she must have stood up with some other poor chap
when my back was turned, and been plamped down
somewhere else. Anyhow, I danced the end of the waltz
with the Marquise de Roquemartine, when she'd finished
doin' the polite to the butler, and when we sat down to
breathe at last, for the sake of somethin' to say I asked if
the fat lady in yellow was her own cook, or a visitor's cook.
Anyhow, I was certain of the <i>cook</i>: fancied myself on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>spottin' a cook anywhere. Well, the marquise giggled
'Take care!' and nearly had a fit. And if there wasn't
my late partner close to my shoulder. 'That's Lady
Turnour, one of my guests,' said the marquise. Little
witch, she looked more pleased than shocked; but 'pon my
honour, you could have knocked me down with a feather.
I hope the good lady didn't hear, but my friends tell me I
talk as if I were yellin' through a megaphone, so I'm
afraid she got the news."</p>

<p>"What did you do?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Do? I jumped up as if I'd been shot, and trotted
over to ask you to dance. But I expect it will get about."</p>

<p>Now I knew why Lady Turnour had glared. Poor
woman! I was really sorry for her&mdash;on this, her happy night!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>


<p>"It never rains, but it pours, after dry weather,"
says Pamela de Nesle. And so it was for the
Turnour family. They had had their run of
luck, and everything determinedly went wrong for them
that night.</p>

<p>For her ladyship, there was the dreadful douche of the
admiral's mistake, and the Marquise de Roquemartine's
coming to hear of it. (Wicked little witch, I'm sure she
couldn't resist telling the story to everyone!) For Bertie,
the blow of an announcement, before the ball was over,
that Miss Nelson was going to marry the Duc de Divonne
(she went out of the room to get engaged to him). For
Sir Samuel, a telegram from his London solicitors advising
him to hurry home and straighten out some annoying
business tangle.</p>

<p>After all, however, I doubt that the telegram ought to be
classed among disasters, as it gave the family a good excuse
to escape without delay from the ch&acirc;teau which they had
so much wished to enter.</p>

<p>Lady Turnour had hysterics in her bedroom, having
retired early on account of a "headache." She pretended
that her rage was caused by a rent in her golden train,
made by "that clumsy Admiral Gray who came over with
the Frasers, and had the impudence to almost <i>force</i> me to
dance with him&mdash;gouty old horror!" But I know it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>the rent in her vanity, not her dress, which made her gurgle,
and wail, and choke, until frightened Sir Samuel patted
her on the back, and she stopped short, to scold him.</p>

<p>Bertie came in, ostensibly to learn his father's plans,
but really, I surmised, to suggest some of his own; and
Lady Turnour relieved her feelings by stirring up evil ones
in him. "So sure you were going to get the girl! Why,
you wrote your stepfather the other day, you were practically
engaged," she sneered, delighted that she was not the
only one who had suffered humiliations at the castle.</p>

<p>"If she hadn't seen you, I believe it would have been all
right," growled Bertie, vicious as a chained dog who has
lost his bone. And then Lady Turnour had hysterics all
over again, and Sir Samuel told Bertie that he was an
ungrateful young brute. The three raged together, and I
could not go, because I had to hold sal-volatile under her
ladyship's nose. Lady Turnour said that the marquise
was no lidy, and for her part she was glad she wasn't going
to have that cat of a sister in <i>her</i> family. She'd leave the
beastly chattoe that night, if she could; but anyhow, she'd
go the first thing in the morning as ever was, so there!
People that let their visitors be insulted, and did nothing
but laugh!&mdash;<i>She'd</i> show them, if they ever came to London,
<i>that</i> she would, though she mightn't be a marquise
herself, exactly. Not one of the lot should ever be invited
to her house, not if they were all married to Bertie. And
who was Bertie, anyhow?</p>

<p>Sir Samuel said 'darling' to her, and quite different
words that began with "d" to his stepson; and Bertie,
seeing the error of his ways, apologized humbly. His
apologies were eventually accepted; and when he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>intimated to her ladyship that she should be introduced to
all his "swell friends" in England, it was settled that he
should make one of the party in the car, his valet travelling
by train. As this arrangement completed itself, Mr.
Bertie suddenly remembered my presence, and flashed me
a look of triumph.</p>

<p>I, listening silently, had been rejoicing in the development
of the situation as far as I was concerned; for the
sooner we got away from the ch&acirc;teau, the less likely was
Monsieur Charretier to succeed in catching us up. But
when I heard that we were to have Bertie with us, my
heart sank, especially as his look told me that I counted
for something in his plan. The chauffeur counted for
something, too, I feared. In any case, the rest of the tour
was spoiled, and if it hadn't been for the thought that
when it was over, Jack and I might meet no more, I should
have wished it cut short.</p>

<p>Good-byes were perfunctory in the morning, and
nobody seemed heartbroken at parting from the Turnour
family. The big luggage, packed early and in haste,
was sent on to Paris; and when the chauffeur had disposed
of Bertie's additions to the Aigle's load, hostilities began.</p>

<p>"Put down that seat for me," said Mr. Stokes to Mr.
Dane, indicating one of the folding chairs in the glass
cage, and carefully waiting to do so until I was within eye
and earshot.</p>

<p>They glared at each other like two tigers, for an instant,
and then Jack put the seat down&mdash;I knew why. A
refusal on his part to do such a service for his master's
stepson would mean that he must resign or be discharged&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>leave me to deal unaided with a cad. I think
Bertie knew, too, why he was unhesitatingly obeyed;
and racked his brain for further tests. It was not long
before he had a brilliant idea.</p>

<p>The car stopped at a level crossing, to let a train go
by, and Bertie availed himself of the opportunity to
get out.</p>

<p>"Sir Samuel's going' to let me try my hand at drivin',"
said he. "I don't think much of your form, and I've
been tellin' him so. My best pal is a director of the
Aigle company, and I've driven his car a lot of times.
Her ladyship will let Elise sit inside, and I'll watch your
style a bit before I take the wheel."</p>

<p>Not a word said Jack. He didn't even look at me as
he helped me down from the seat which had been mine
for so many happy days. I crept miserably into the
stuffy glass cage, where, in the folding chair, I sat as far
forward as my own shape and the car's allowed; Sir
Samuel's fat knees in my back, Lady Turnour's sharp
voice in my ears. And for scenery, I had Bertie's aggressive
shoulders and supercilious gesticulations.</p>

<p>The road to Nevers I scarcely saw. I think it was
flat; but Bertie's driving made it play cup and ball
with the car in a curious way, which a good chauffeur
could hardly have managed if he tried. We passed
Riom, Gannat, Aigueperse, I know; and at Moulins,
in the valley of the Allier, we lunched in a hurry. To
Nevers we came early, but it was there we were to stop
for the night, and there we did stop, in a drizzle of rain
which prevented sight-seeing for those who had the wish,
and the freedom, to go about. As for me, I was ordered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>by Lady Turnour to mend Mr. Stokes's socks, he having
made peace by offering to "give her a swagger dinner
in town."</p>

<p>Bertie's cleverness was not confined to ingratiating
himself with her ladyship. He contrived adroitly to
damage the steering-gear by grazing a wall as he turned
the Aigle into the hotel courtyard, and by this feat disposed
of the chauffeur's evening, which was spent in
hard work at the garage. Such dinner as Jack got, he ate
there, in the shape of a furtive sandwich or two, otherwise
we should not have been able to leave in the
morning at the early hour suggested by Mr. Stokes.</p>

<p>Warned by the incidents of yesterday, Sir Samuel
desired his chauffeur to take the wheel again from Nevers
to Paris. But&mdash;no doubt with the view of keeping us
apart, and devising new tortures for his enemy&mdash;Bertie
elected to play Wolf to Jack's Spartan Boy, and sit beside
him. This relegated me to the cage again, with back-massage
from Sir Samuel's knees.</p>

<p>Before Fontainebleau, I found myself in a familiar
land. As far as Montargis I had motored with the
Milvaines more than once, conducted by Monsieur
Charretier, in a great car which might have been mine
if I had accepted it, not "with a pound of tea," but with
two hundred pounds of millionaire. I knew the lovely
valley of the Loing, and the forest which makes the
world green and shadowy from Bourrau to Fontainebleau,
a world where poetry and history clasp hands. I should
have had plenty to say about it all to Jack, if we had been
together, but I was still inside the car, and by this time
Bertie had induced his stepfather to consent to his driving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>again. He pleaded that there had been something wrong
with the ignition yesterday. That was why the car had
not gone well. It had not been his fault at all. Sir
Samuel, always inclined to say "Yes" rather than "No"
to one he loved, said "Yes" to Bertie, and had cause
to regret it. Close to Fontainebleau Mr. Stokes saw
another car, with a pretty girl in it. The car was going
faster than ours, as it was higher powered and had a
lighter load. Naturally, being himself, it occurred to
Bertie that it would be well to show the pretty girl what
he could do. We were going up hill, as it happened, and
he changed speed with a quick, fierce crash. The Aigle
made a sound as if she were gritting her teeth, shivered,
and began to run back. Bertie, losing his head, tried a
lower speed, which had no effect, and Lady Turnour had
begun to shriek when Jack leaned across and put on the
hand-brake. The car stopped, just in time not to run
down a pony cart full of children.</p>

<p>No wonder the poor dear Aigle had gritted her teeth!
Several of them turned out to be broken in the gear box.</p>

<p>"We're done!" said Jack. "She'll have to be towed
to the nearest garage. Pity we couldn't have got on to Paris."</p>

<p>"Can't you put in some false teeth?" suggested Lady
Turnour, at which Bertie laughed, and was thereupon
reproached for the accident, as he well deserved to be.</p>

<p>Then the question was what should be the next step
for the passengers. I expected to be trotted reluctantly
on to Paris by train, leaving Jack behind to find a "tow,"
and see the dilemma through to an end of some sort,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>but to my joyful surprise Bertie used all his wiles upon
the family to induce them to stop at Fontainebleau.
It was a beautiful place, he argued, and they would like
it so much, that they would come to think the breakdown
a blessing in disguise. In any case, he had intended
advising them to pause for tea, and to stay the night if
they cared for the place. They would find a good hotel,
practically in the forest; and he had an acquaintance
who owned a ch&acirc;teau near by, a very important sort
of chap, who knew everybody worth knowing in French
society. If the Governor and "Lady T." liked, he would
go dig his friend up, and bring him round to call. Maybe
they'd all be invited to the ch&acirc;teau for dinner. The
man had a lot of motors and would send one for them,
very likely&mdash;perhaps would even lend a car to take
them on to Paris to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>I listened to these arguments and suggestions with a
creepy feeling in the roots of my hair, for I, too, have
an "acquaintance" who owns a ch&acirc;teau near Fontainebleau:
a certain Monsieur Charretier. He, also,
has a "lot of motors" and would, I knew, if he were "in
residence" be delighted to lend a car and extend an
invitation to dinner, if informed that Lys d'Angely was
of the party. Could it be, I thought, that Mr. Stokes
was acquainted with Monsieur Charretier, or that, not
being acquainted, he had heard something from the
Duchesse de Melun, and was making a little experiment with me?</p>

<p>Perhaps I imagined it, but it seemed that he glanced
my way triumphantly, when Lady Turnour agreed to
stay in the hope of meeting the nameless, but important,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>friend; and I felt that, whatever happened, I must have
a word of advice from Jack.</p>

<p>The discussion had taken place in the road, or rather,
at the side of the road, where the combined exertions
of Jack and Bertie had pushed the wounded Aigle. The
chauffeur, having examined the car and pronounced her
helpless, walked back to interview a carter we had passed
not long before, with the view of procuring a tow. Now,
just as the discussion was decided in favour of stopping
over night at Fontainebleau, he appeared again, in the cart.</p>

<p>We were so near the hotel in the woods that we could
be towed there in half an hour, and, ignominious as the
situation was, Lady Turnour preferred it to the greater
evil of walking. I remained in the car with her, the
chauffeur steered, the carter towed, and Sir Samuel and
his stepson started on in advance, on foot.</p>

<p>At the hotel Jack was to leave us, and be towed to a
garage; but, in desperation, I murmured an appeal as
he gave me an armful of rugs. "I <i>must</i> ask you about
something," I whispered. "Can you come back in a
little less than an hour, and look for me in the woods,
somewhere just out of sight of the hotel?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I can and will. You may depend on me."</p>

<p>That was all, but I was comforted, and the rugs became
suddenly light.</p>

<p>Rooms were secured, great stress being laid upon a
good sitting-room (in case the important friend should
call), and I unpacked as usual. When my work was
done, I asked her ladyship's permission to go out for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>little while. She looked suspicious, clawed her brains
for an excuse to refuse, but, as there wasn't a buttonless
glove, or a holey stocking among the party, she
reluctantly gave me leave. I darted away, plunged
into the forest, and did not stop walking until I had got
well out of sight of the hotel. Then I sat down on a
mossy log under a great tree, and looked about for Jack.</p>

<p>A man was coming. I jumped up eagerly, and went to
meet him as he appeared among the trees.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Herbert Stokes.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>


<p>"I followed you," he said.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said I. "It was like you."</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you," he explained.</p>

<p>"But I don't want to talk to you," I objected.</p>

<p>"You'll be sorry if you're rude. What I came to
say is for your own good."</p>

<p>"I doubt that!" said I, looking anxiously down one
avenue of trees after another, for a figure that would
have been doubly welcome now.</p>

<p>"Well, I can easily prove it, if you'll listen."</p>

<p>"As you have longer legs than I have, I am obliged to listen."</p>

<p>"You won't regret it. Now, come, my dear little
girl, don't put on any more frills with me. I'm gettin'
a bit fed up with 'em."</p>

<p>(I should have liked to choke him with a whole mouthful
of "frills," the paper kind you put on ham at Christmas;
but as I had none handy, I thought it would only
lead to undignified controversy to allude to them.)</p>

<p>"I had a little conversation about you with the Duchesse
de Melun night before last," Bertie went on, with evident
relish. "Ah, I thought that would make you blush. I
say, you're prettier than ever when you do that! It was
she began it. She asked me if I knew your name, and
how Lady T. found you. Her Ladyship couldn't get any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>further than 'Elise,' for, if she knew any more, she'd
forgotten it; but thanks to your friend the shuvver, I
could go one better. When I told the duchess you called
yourself d'Angely, or something like that, she said 'I was
sure of it!' Now, I expect you begin to smell a rat&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"I daresay you've been carrying one about in your
pocket ever since," I snapped, "though I can't think
what it has to do with me. I'm not interested in dead rats."</p>

<p>"This is your own rat," said Bertie, grinning.
"What'll you give to know what the duchess told me about you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll be generous and let you have it for
nothing. She told me she thought she recognized you,
but until she heard the name, she supposed she must be
mistaken; that it was only a remarkable resemblance
between my stepmother's maid and a girl who'd run
away under very peculiar circumstances from the house
of a friend of hers. What do you think of that?"</p>

<p>"That the duchess is a cat," I replied, promptly.</p>

<p>"Most women are."</p>

<p>"In <i>your</i> set, perhaps."</p>

<p>"She said there was a man mixed up with the story,
a rich middle-aged chap of the name of Charretier, with
a big house in Paris and a new ch&acirc;teau he'd built, near
Fontainebleau. She gave me a card to him."</p>

<p>"He's sure not to be at home," I remarked.</p>

<p>Bertie's face fell; but he brightened again. "Anyhow
you admit you know him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>"One has all sorts of acquaintances," I drawled, with
a shrug of my shoulders.</p>

<p>"You're a sly little kitten&mdash;if you're not a cat. You
heard me say I thought of calling at the ch&acirc;teau."</p>

<p>"And you heard me say the owner wasn't at home."</p>

<p>"You seem well acquainted with his movements."</p>

<p>"I happened to see him, on his way south, at Avignon,
some days ago."</p>

<p>"Did he see you?"</p>

<p>"Isn't that my affair&mdash;and his?"</p>

<p>"By Jove&mdash;you've got good cheek, to talk like this
to your mistress's stepson! But maybe you think you
won't have difficulty in finding a place that pays you
better&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't find one to pay me much worse."</p>

<p>"Look here, my dear, I'm not out huntin' for repartee.
I want to have an understanding with you."</p>

<p>"I don't see why."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do, well enough. You know I like you&mdash;in
spite of your impudence."</p>

<p>"And I dislike you because of yours. Oh, do go
away and leave me, Mr. Stokes."</p>

<p>"I won't. I've got a lot to say to you. I've only
just begun, but you keep interruptin' me, and I can't
get ahead."</p>

<p>"Finish then."</p>

<p>"Well, what I want to say is this. I always meant we
should stop at Fontainebleau."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;you damaged your stepfather's car on purpose!
He would be obliged to you."</p>

<p>"Not quite that. I intended to get them to have tea
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>here, and while they were moonin' about I was going to
have a chat with you. I was goin' to tell you about that
card to Charretier, and somethin' else. That the
duchess asked me where we would stop in Paris, and I
told her at the best there is, of course&mdash;Hotel Athen&eacute;e.
She said she'd wire her friends you'd run away from,
that they could find you there; and if Charretier wasn't at
Fontainebleau when we passed through, these people
would certainly know where to get at him. I warned
you the other night, didn't I? that if you wouldn't
be good and confide in me I'd find out what you
refused to tell me yourself; and I have, you see. Clever,
aren't I?"</p>

<p>"You're the hatefullest man I ever <i>heard</i> of!" I flung
at him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say! Don't speak too soon. You don't
know all yet. If you don't want me to, I won't call on
Charretier. Lady T. and her tuft-huntin' can go hang!
And you shan't stop at the Athen&eacute;e to be copped by the
Duchess's friends, if you don't like. That's what I
wanted to see you about. To tell you it all depends on yourself."</p>

<p>"How does it depend on myself?" I asked, cautiously.</p>

<p>"All you have to do, to get off scot free is to be a
little kind to poor Bertie. You can begin by givin' him
a kiss, here in the poetic and what-you-may-call-'em
forest of Fontainebleau."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't kiss you if you were made of gold and
diamonds, and I could have you melted down to spend!"
I exclaimed. And as I delivered this ultimatum, I
turned to run. His legs might be longer than mine, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
I weighed about one-third as much as he, which was in
my favour if I chose to throw dignity to the winds.</p>

<p>As I whisked away from him, he caught me by the
dress, and I heard the gathers rip. I had to stop. I
couldn't arrive at the hotel without a skirt.</p>

<p>"You're a cad&mdash;a <i>cad</i>!" I stammered.</p>

<p>"And you're a fool. Look here, I can lose you your
job and have you sent to the prison where naughty girls
go. See what I've got in my pocket."</p>

<p>Still grasping my frock, he scooped something out of
an inner pocket of his coat, and held it for me to
look at, in the hollow of his palm. I gave a little cry.
It was Lady Turnour's gorgeous bursting sun.</p>

<p>"I nicked that off the dressin' table the other night,
when you weren't looking. Has Lady T. been askin' for it?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, speaking more to myself than to
him. "She&mdash;she's had too much to think of. She
didn't count her things that night; and at Nevers she
didn't open the bag."</p>

<p>"So much the worse for you, my pet, when she does
find out. She left her jewels in your charge. When I
came into the room, they were all lyin' about on the dressin'
table, and you were playin' with 'em."</p>

<p>"I was putting them back into her bag."</p>

<p>"So you say. Jolly careless of you not to know
you hadn't put this thing back. It's about the
best of the lot she hadn't got plastered on for the
servants' ball."</p>

<p>"It was careless," I admitted. "But it was your
fault. You came in, and were so horrid, and upset me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>so much that I forgot what I'd put into the bag already,
and what I hadn't."</p>

<p>"Lady T. doesn't know I went back to her room."</p>

<p>"I'll tell her!" I cried.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you'll tell her, right enough. But I can
tell a different story. I'll say I didn't go near the
room. My story will be that I was walkin' through the
woods this afternoon on my way to Charretier's ch&acirc;teau
when I saw you with the thing in your hands, lookin' at
it. Probably goin' to ask the shuvver to dispose of it
for you&mdash;what? and share profits."</p>

<p>"Oh, you coward!" I exclaimed, and snatched the
diamond brooch from him.</p>

<p>Instantly he let go my dress, laughing.</p>

<p>"<i>That's</i> right! That's what I wanted," he said.
"Now you've got it, and you can keep it. I'll tell Lady
T. where to look for it&mdash;unless you'll change your mind,
and give me that kiss."</p>

<p>I was so angry, so stricken with horror and a kind of
nightmare fear which I had not time to analyze, that
I stood silent, trembling all over, with the brooch in my
hand. How silly I had been to play his game for him,
just like the poor stupid cat who pulled the hot chestnut
out of the fire! I don't think any chestnut could ever
have been as hot as that bursting sun!</p>

<p>I wanted to drop it in the grass, or throw it as far as
I could see it, but dared not, because it would be my
fault that it was lost, and Lady Turnour would believe
Bertie's story all the more readily. She would think he
had seen me with the jewel, and that I'd hidden it because
I was afraid of what he might do.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>"To kiss, or not to kiss. <i>That's</i> the question,"
laughed Bertie.</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Jack. And Jack's hand, inside Mr. Stokes's
beautiful, tall collar, shook Bertie back and forth
till his teeth chattered like castanets, and his good-looking
pink face grew more and more like a large, boiled
beetroot.</p>

<p>I had seen Jack coming, long enough to have counted
ten before he came. But I didn't count ten. I just let him come.</p>

<p>Bertie could not speak: he could only gurgle. And
if I had been a Roman lady in the amphitheatre of N&icirc;mes,
or somewhere, I'm afraid I should have wanted to turn
my thumb down.</p>

<p>"What was the beast threatening you with?" Jack
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"The beast was threatening to make Lady Turnour
think I'd stolen this brooch, which he'd taken himself,"
I panted, through the beatings of my heart.</p>

<p>"If you didn't kiss him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And he was going to do lots of other horrid
things, too. Tell Monsieur Charretier&mdash;and let my
cousins come and find me at the Hotel Athen&eacute;e, in Paris, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He won't do any of them. But there are several
things I am going to do to him. Go away, my child.
Run off to the house, as quick as you can."</p>

<p>I gasped. "What are you going to do to him?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry. I shan't hurt him nearly as much as
he deserves. I'm only going to do what the Head must
have neglected to do to him at school."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>Bertie had come out into the woods with a neat little
stick, which during part of our conversation he had
tucked jauntily under his arm. It now lay on the ground.
I saw Jack glance at it.</p>

<p>"Ah!"&mdash;I faltered. "Do&mdash;do you think you'd <i>better</i>?"</p>

<p>"I know I had. Go, child."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>


<p>Unfortunately I forgot to ask for
instructions as to how I should behave when I
came to the hotel. And I had the bursting sun
still in my hand.</p>

<p>I thought things over, as well as I could with a pounding
pulse for every square inch in my body.</p>

<p>If I were a rabbit, I could scurry into my hole and
"lay low" while other people fought out their destiny
and arranged mine; but being a girl, tingling with my
share of American pluck, and blazing with French fire,
rabbits seemed to me at the instant only worthy of being
made into pie.</p>

<p>Bertie, at this moment, was being made into pie&mdash;humble
pie; and I don't doubt that the chauffeur, whom
he had consistently tortured (because of me) would make
him eat a large slice of himself when the humble pie was
finished&mdash;also because of me. And because it was
because of me, I knocked at the Turnours' sitting-room
door with a bold, brave knock, as if I thought myself
their social equal.</p>

<p>They had had tea, and were sitting about, looking graceful
in the expectation of seeing Bertie and his French friend.</p>

<p>It was a disappointment to her ladyship to see only
me, and she showed it with a frown, but Sir Samuel
looked up kindly, as usual.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>I laid the bursting sun on the table, and told them
everything, very fast, without pausing to take breath,
so that they wouldn't have time to stop me. But I
didn't begin with the bursting sun, or even with the beating
that Bertie was enjoying in the woods; I began with
the Princess Boriskoff, and Lady Kilmarny; and I
addressed Sir Samuel, from beginning to end. Somehow,
I felt I had his sympathy, even when I rushed at the most
embarrassing part, which concerned his stepson and
the necktie.</p>

<p>Just as I'd told about the brooch, and Bertie's threat,
and was coming to his punishment, another knock at
the door produced the two young men, both pale, but
Jack with a noble pallor, while Bertie's was the sick
paleness of pain and shame.</p>

<p>"I've brought him to apologize to Miss d'Angely,
in your presence, Sir Samuel, and Lady Turnour's,"
said the chauffeur. "I see you know something of the story."</p>

<p>"They know all now," said I. For Bertie's face
proved the truth of my words, if they had needed proof.
His eyes were swimming in tears, and he looked like a
whipped school-boy.</p>

<p>But suddenly a whim roused her ladyship to speak
up in his defence&mdash;or at least to criticize the chauffeur
for presuming to take her stepson's chastisement into
his hands.</p>

<p>"What right have you to set yourself up as Elise's
champion, anyway?" she demanded, shrilly. "Have
you and she been getting engaged to each other behind
our backs?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>"It would be my highest happiness to be engaged
to Miss d'Angely if she would marry me," said Jack,
with such a splendidly sincere ring in his voice that I
could almost have believed him if I hadn't known he was
in love with another woman. "But I am no match for
her. It's only as her friend that I have acted in her
defence, as any decent man has a right to act when a
lady is insulted."</p>

<p>Then Bertie apologized, in a dull voice, with his eyes
on the ground, and mumbled a kind of confession,
mixed with self-justification. He had pocketed the
brooch, yes, meaning to play a trick, but had intended
no harm, only a little fun&mdash;pretty girl&mdash;lady's-maids
didn't usually mind a bit of a flirtation and a present
or two; how was he to know this one was different?
Sorry if he had caused annoyance; could say no more&mdash;and
so on, and so on, until I stopped him, having heard enough.</p>

<p>Poor Sir Samuel was crestfallen, but not too utterly
crushed to reproach his bride with unwonted sharpness,
when she would have scolded me for carelessness
in not putting the brooch away. "Let the girl alone!"
he grumbled, "she's a very good girl, and has behaved
well. I wish I could say the same of others nearer to me."</p>

<p>"Of course, Sir Samuel, after what's happened, you
wouldn't want me to stay in your employ, any more
than I would want to stay," said Jack. "Unfortunately
the Aigle will be hung up two or three days, till new pinions
can be fitted in, at the garage. I can send them out
from Paris, if you like; but no doubt you'll prefer to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>have my engagement with you to come to an end to-day.
Mr. Stokes has driven the car, and can again."</p>

<p>"Not if I have anything to say about it," murmured
her ladyship. "Scattering the poor thing's teeth all over
the place!"</p>

<p>"There are plenty of good chauffeurs to be got at short
notice in Paris," Jack suggested, "and you are certain
to find one by the time you're ready to start."</p>

<p>"You're right, Dane. We'll have to part company,"
said Sir Samuel. "As for Elise here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She'll have to go too," broke in her ladyship. "It's
most inconvenient, and all your stepson's fault&mdash;though
she's far from blameless, in my humble opinion, whatever
yours may be. Don't tell me that a young man will go
about flirting with lady's maids unless they encourage him!"</p>

<p>"I shall leave of course, immediately," said I, my ears tingling.</p>

<p>"Who wants you to do anything else? Though nobody
cares for <i>my</i> convenience. <i>I</i> can always go to the wall.
But thank heaven there are maids in Paris as well as
chauffeurs. And talking of that combination, my advice
to you is, if Dane's willing to have you, don't turn up your
nose at him, but marry him as quickly as you can. I
suppose even in your class of life there's such a thing as
<i>gossip</i>."</p>

<p>I was scarlet. Somehow I got out of the room, and
while I was scurrying my few belongings into my dressing
bag, and spreading out the red satin frock to leave as a
legacy to Lady Turnour (in any case, nothing could have
induced me to wear it again), Sir Samuel sent me up an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>envelope containing a month's wages, and something
over. I enclosed the "something over" in another
envelope, with a grateful line of refusal, and sent it back.</p>

<p>Thus ends my experience as a motor maid!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>What was going to become of me I didn't know, but
while I was jamming in hatpins and praying for ideas,
there came a knock at the door. A pencilled note from
the late chauffeur, signed hastily, "Yours ever, J.D.,"
and inviting me down to the couriers' dining-room for a
conference. There would be no one there but ourselves
at this hour, he said, and we should be able to talk over
our plans in peace.</p>

<p>What a place to say farewell forever to the only man I
ever had, could or would love&mdash;a couriers' dining room,
with grease spots on the tablecloth! However, there was
no help for it, since I was facing the world with fifty francs,
and could not afford to pay for a romantic background.</p>

<p>After all that had happened, and especially after certain
impertinent references made to our private affairs, I felt
a new and very embarrassing shyness in meeting the man
with whom I'd been playing that pleasant little game
called "brother and sister." He was waiting for me in
the couriers' room, which was even dingier and had more
grease spots than I had fancied, and I hurried into speech
to cover my nervousness.</p>

<p>"I don't know how I'm going to thank you for all
you've done for me," I stammered. "That horrible Bertie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let's not talk of him," said Jack. "Put him out
of your mind for ever. He has no place there, or in your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>life&mdash;and no more have any of the incidents that led
up to him. You've had a very bad time of it, poor little
girl, and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't," I exclaimed. "I've been happier
than ever before in my life. That is&mdash;I&mdash;it was all
so novel, and like a play&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, now the play's over," Jack broke in, pitying
my evident embarrassment. "I wanted to ask you if
you'd let me advise and perhaps help you. We <i>have</i>
been brother and sister, you know. Nothing can take
that away from us."</p>

<p>"No," said I, in a queer little voice. "Nothing can."</p>

<p>"You want to go to England, I know," he went on.
"And&mdash;if you'll forgive my taking liberties, you haven't
much money in hand, you've almost told me. I suppose
you haven't changed your mind about your relations in
Paris? You wouldn't like to go back to them, or write,
and tell them firmly that you won't marry the person they
seem to have set their hearts on for you? That you've
made your own choice, and intend to abide by it; but that
if they'll be sensible and receive you, you're willing to
stop with them until&mdash;until the man in England&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> man in England?" I cut him short, in utter
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Why, the&mdash;er&mdash;you didn't tell me his name, of
course, but that rich chap you expected to meet when
you got over to England. Don't you think it would be
better if he came to you at your cousins', if they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There <i>isn't</i> any 'rich chap'," I exclaimed. "I don't
know what you mean&mdash;oh, <i>yes</i>, I do, too. I did speak
about someone who was very rich, and would be kind to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>me. I rather think&mdash;I remember now&mdash;I <i>guessed</i> you
imagined it was a man; but that seemed the greatest joke,
so I didn't try to undeceive you. Fancy your believing
that, all this time, though, and thinking about it!"</p>

<p>"I've thought of it on an average once every three
minutes," said Jack.</p>

<p>"You're chaffing now, of course. Why, the person I
hoped might be kind to me in England is an old lady&mdash;oh,
but such a funny old lady!&mdash;who wanted me to be
her companion, and said, no matter when I came, if it
were years from now, I must let her know, for she would
like to have me with her to help chase away a dragon of
a maid she's afraid of. I met her only once, in the train
the night before I arrived at Cannes; but she and I got
to be the greatest friends, and her bulldog, Beau&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Her bulldog, Beau!"</p>

<p>"A perfect lamb, though he looks like a cross between
a crocodile and a gnome. The old lady's name is Miss Paget&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My aunt!"</p>

<p>I stared at Jack, not knowing how to take this exclamation.
The few Englishmen I met when mamma and I
were together, or when I lived with the Milvaines, were
rather fond of using that ejaculation when it was
apparently quite irrelevant. If you told a youthful
Englishman that you were not allowed to walk or
bicycle alone in the Bois, he was as likely as not to
say "My aunt!" In fact, whatever surprised him was
apt to elicit this cry. I have known several young men
who gave vent to it at intervals of from half to
three-quarters of an hour; but I had never before heard Jack
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>make the exclamation, so when I had looked at him and
he had looked at me in an emotional kind of silence for a
few seconds, I asked him, "Why 'My aunt'?"</p>

<p>"Because she is my aunt."</p>

<p>"Surely not my Miss Paget?"</p>

<p>"I should think it highly improbable that your Miss
Paget and my Miss Paget could be the same, if you
hadn't mentioned her bulldog, Beau. There can't be a
quantity of Miss Pagets going about the world with bulldogs
named Beau. Only my Miss Paget never does go
about the world. She hates travelling."</p>

<p>"So does mine. She said that being in a train was
no pursuit for a gentlewoman."</p>

<p>"That sounds like her. She's quite mad."</p>

<p>"She seemed very kind."</p>

<p>"I'm glad she did&mdash;to you. She has seemed rather
the contrary to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, what did she do to you?"</p>

<p>"Did her best to spoil my life, that's all&mdash;with the
best intentions, no doubt. Still, by Jove, I thank her!
If it hadn't been for my aunt I should never have seen&mdash;my sister."</p>

<p>"Thank you. You're always kind&mdash;and polite. Do
you mean it was because of <i>her</i> you took to what you call
'shuvving'?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"But I thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't dare tell you."</p>

<p>"I should think you might know by this time that you
can tell me anything. You <i>must</i> tell me!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>"I thought it was the beautiful lady who was with
you the first time you saw the battlement garden at
Beaucaire, who ruined your life?"</p>

<p>"Beautiful lady&mdash;battlement garden? Good heavens,
what extraordinary things we seem to have been thinking
about each other: I with my man in England; you with
your beautiful lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's a different thing. You <i>talked</i> to me about
her," I insisted. "Surely you must remember?"</p>

<p>"I remember the conversation perfectly. I didn't
explain my meaning as a professor demonstrates a rule
in higher mathematics, but I thought you couldn't help
understanding well enough, especially a vain little thing
like you."</p>

<p>"I, vain? Oh!"</p>

<p>"You are, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;well, I'm afraid I am, a little."</p>

<p>"You could never have looked in the glass if you
weren't. Didn't you see, or guess, that I was talking
about an Ideal whom I had conjured into being, as a
desirable companion in that garden? I can't understand
from the way the conversation ran, how you could
have helped it. When I first went to the battlement
garden I was several years younger, steeped with the
spirit of Provence and full of thoughts of Nicolete. I
was just sentimental enough to imagine that such a girl
as Nicolete was with me there, and always afterward I
associated the vision of the Ideal with that garden. I
said to myself, that I should like to come there again
with that Ideal in the flesh. And then&mdash;then I did
come again&mdash;with you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>"But you said&mdash;you thought of her always&mdash;that
because you couldn't have her&mdash;or something of
the sort&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, all that was no surprise to you, was it? You
must have known perfectly well&mdash;ever since that night
at Avignon when you let your hair down, anyhow, if not
before, that I was trying desperately hard not to be an
idiot about you&mdash;and not exactly radiant with joy in
the thought that whoever the man was who would get
you, it couldn't be I?"</p>

<p>"O-oh!" I breathed a long, heavenly breath, that
seemed to let all the sorrows and worries pour out of my
heart, as the air rushed out of my lungs. "O-oh, you
<i>can't</i> mean, truly and really, that you're in love with
Me, can you?"</p>

<p>"Surely it isn't news to you."</p>

<p>"I should think it was!" I exclaimed, rapturously.
"Oh, I'm so happy!"</p>

<p>"Another scalp&mdash;though a humble one?"</p>

<p>"Don't be a beast. I'm so horribly in love with you,
you know. It's been hurting so <i>dreadfully</i>."</p>

<p>Then I rather think he said "My darling!" but I'm
not quite sure, for I was so busy falling into his arms,
and he was holding me so very, very tightly.</p>

<p>We stayed like that for a long time, not saying anything,
and not even thinking, but feeling&mdash;feeling.
And the couriers' dining-room was a princess's boudoir
in an enchanted palace. The grease spots were stars and
moons that had rolled out of heaven to see how two poor
mortals looked when they were perfectly happy. Just a
poor chauffeur and a motor maid: but the world was theirs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>


<p>After a while we talked again, and explained all
the cross-purposes to each other, with the most
interesting pauses in between the explanations.
And Jack told me about himself, and Miss Paget.</p>

<p>It seems that her only sister was his mother, and she
had been in love with his father before he met the sister.
The father's name was Claud, and Jack was named
after him. It was Miss Paget's favourite name, because
of the man she had loved. But the first Claud wasn't
very lucky. He lost all his own money and most of his
wife's, and died in South America, where he'd gone in
the hope of making more. Then the wife, Jack's mother,
died too, while he was at Eton. After that Miss Paget's
house was his home. Whenever he was extravagant at
Oxford, as he was sometimes, she would pay his debts
quite happily, and tell him that everything she had would
be his some day, so he was not to bother about money.
Accordingly, he didn't bother, but lived rather a lazy
life&mdash;so he said&mdash;and enjoyed himself. A couple of
years before I met him he got interested, through a
friend, in a newly invented motor, which they both
thought would be a wonderful success. Jack tried to
get his aunt interested, too, but she didn't like the friend
who had invented it&mdash;seemed jealous of Jack's affection
for him&mdash;and refused to have anything to do with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>the affair. Jack had gone so far, however, while taking
her consent for granted, that he felt bound to go on; and
when Miss Paget would have nothing to do with floating
the new invention, Jack sold out the investments of his
own little fortune (all that was left of his mother's money),
putting everything at his friend's disposal. Miss Paget
was disgusted with him for doing this, and when the
motor wouldn't mote and the invention wouldn't float,
she just said, "I told you so!"</p>

<p>It was at this time, Jack went on to tell me, that Miss
Paget bought Beau. She had had another dog, given her
by Jack, which died, and she collected Beau herself.
Only a few days after Beau's arrival, Jack went down
into the country to see his aunt and talk things over; for
she had brought him up to expect to be her heir; and as
she wanted him with her continually, as if he had been her
son, she had objected to his taking up any profession.
Now that he'd lost his own money in this unfortunate
speculation, he felt he ought to do something not to be
dependent upon her, his income of two hundred a year
having been sunk with the unfloatable motor invention.
He meant to ask Miss Paget to lend him enough to go in
as partner with another friend, who had a very thriving
motor business, and to suggest paying her back so much
a year. But everything was against him on that visit
to his aunt's country house.</p>

<p>In the first place, she was in a very bad humour with
him, because he had gone against her wishes, and she
didn't want to hear anything more about motors or
motor business. Then, there was Beau, as a <i>tertium quid</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>Beau had been bought from a dreadful man who had
probably stolen, and certainly ill-treated him. The dog
was very young, and owing to his late owner's cruelty,
feared and hated the sight of a man. Since she had had
him Miss Paget had done her very best to spoil the poor
animal, encouraging him to growl at the men-servants,
and laughing when he frightened away any male creature
who had come about the place. While she and Jack
were arguing over money and motors, who should stroll
in but Beau, who at sight of a stranger&mdash;a man&mdash;closeted
with his indulgent mistress, flew into a rage. He
seized Jack by the trouser-leg and began to worry it,
and Jack had to choke him before the dog would let go
his grip.</p>

<p>The sight of this dreadful deed threw Miss Paget into
hysterics. She shrieked that her nephew was cruel,
ungrateful&mdash;that he had never loved her, that he cared
only for her money, and now that he grudged her the affection
of a dog with which <i>he</i> had had nothing to do; that
the dog's dislike for him was a warning to her, and made
her see him in his true light at last. "Go&mdash;go&mdash;out of
my sight&mdash;or I'll set my poor darling at you!" she
cried, and Jack went, after saying several rather frank things.</p>

<p>At heart he was fond of his aunt, in spite of her eccentricities,
and believed that she was of him, therefore he
expected a letter of apology for her injustice and a request
to come back. But no such letter ever arrived. Perhaps
Miss Paget thought it was <i>his</i> place to apologize, and
was waiting for him to do so. In any case, they had
never seen each other again; and after a few weeks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
Jack received a formal note from his aunt's solicitor
saying that, as she realized now he had "no real
affection for her or <i>hers</i>" he need look for no future
advantages from her, but was at liberty to take up
any line of business he chose. Miss Paget would "no
longer attempt to interfere with his wishes or direct
his affairs."</p>

<p>This must have been a pleasant letter for a penniless
young man, just robbed of all his future prospects. His
own money gone, and no hope of any to put into a profession
or business! Jack lived as he could for some
months, trying for all sorts of positions, making a few
guineas by sketches and motoring articles for newspapers,
and somehow contriving to keep out of debt. He went
to France to "write up" a great automobile race, as a
special commission; but the paper which had given the
commission&mdash;a new one devoted to the interests of motoring&mdash;suddenly
failed. Jack found himself stranded;
advertised for a position as chauffeur, and got it. There
was the history which he "hadn't inflicted on me before,
lest I should be bored."</p>

<p>He was interested to hear of Miss Paget's journey to
Italy, and knew all about the cousin who had died, leaving
her money which she didn't need, and a castle in Italy
which she didn't want. He laughed when I told him
how the redoubtable Simpkins refused to trust herself upon
that "great nasty wet thing," which was the Channel:
but nothing could hold his attention firmly except <i>our</i>
affairs. For his affairs and my affairs were not separate
any longer. They were joined together for weal or
woe. Whatever happened, however imprudent the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>step might be, he decided that we must be married.
We loved each other; each was the other's world, and
nothing must part us. Besides, said Jack, I needed a
protector. I had no home, and he could not have me
persecuted by creatures who produced Corn Plasters. His
idea was to take me to England at once, and have me there
promptly made Mrs. John Dane, by special licence. He
had a few pounds, and a few things which he could sell
would bring in a few more. Then, with me for an
incentive, he should get something to do that was worth doing.</p>

<p>I said "Yes" to everything, and Jack darted away to
converse with a nice man he had met in the garage, who
had a motor, and was going to Paris almost immediately.
If he had not gone yet, perhaps he would take us.</p>

<p>Luckily he had not gone, and he did take us. He
took us to the Gare du Nord, where we would just
have time to eat something, and catch the boat train
for Calais. We should be in London in the morning,
and Jack would apply for a special licence as early as possible.</p>

<p>I stood guarding our humble heap of luggage, while
Jack spent his hard-earned sovereigns for our tickets,
when suddenly I heard a voice which sounded vaguely
familiar. It was broken with distress and excitement;
still I felt sure I had heard it before, and turned quickly,
exclaiming "Miss Paget!"</p>

<p>There she was, with a dressing bag in one hand, and
a broken dog-leash in the other. Tears were running
down her fat face (not so fat as it had been) under spectacles,
and her false front was put on anyhow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>"Oh, my dear girl!" she wailed, without showing the
slightest sign of astonishment at sight of me. "What a
mercy you've turned up, but it's just like you. Have
you seen my Beau anywhere?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, rather stiffly, for I couldn't forgive her
or her dog for their treatment of my Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, what shall I do!" she exclaimed. "He
hates railway stations. You can't think the awful
time we've had since you left me in the train at
Cannes. And now he's broken his leash, and run
away, and I can't speak any French, except to ask
for hot water in Italian, and I don't see how I'm going
to find my darling again. They'll snatch him up, to
fling him into some terrible, murderous waggon, and
take him to a lethal home, or whatever they call it.
For heaven's sake, go and ask everybody where he
is&mdash;and if you find him you can have anything on
earth I've got, especially my Italian castle which I
can't sell. You can come to England with me and
Beau, when you've got him, and I'll make you happy
all the rest of your life. Oh, go&mdash;<i>do</i> go. I'll look
after your luggage."</p>

<p>"It's half your own nephew's, Jack Dane's, luggage,"
said I, breathless and pulsing. "I'm going to England
with him, and <i>he's</i> going to make me happy all the rest
of my life, for we mean to be married, in spite of your
cruelty which has made him poor, and turned him into a
chauffeur. But&mdash;here he comes now. And&mdash;why,
Miss Paget, there's <i>Beau</i> walking with him, without any
leash. Beau must remember him."</p>

<p>"Beau with Jack Dane!" gasped the old lady. "Jack
Dane's found Beau? <i>Beau's</i> forgiven him! Then so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>will I. You can both have the Italian castle&mdash;and
everything that goes with it. And everything else that's
mine, too, except Beau."</p>

<p>"Hello, aunt, here's your dog," said Jack.</p>

<p>Beau licked his foot.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
